      "description": "The Tissue Damage network depicts the causal mechanisms leading to the secretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) following tissue injury. The network includes pathways related to the detection of DAMPs, which serve to perpetuate heightened immune responses to noninfectious tissue insult."

The best characterized of these is the MyD88-dependent pathway, common to all TLRs except TLR3, which results in rapid activation of the transcription molecules nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B), activator protein 1 and Elk-1 and induction of proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

Using mice deficient in the Irf7 gene (Irf7-/- mice), we show that the transcription factor IRF-7 is essential for the induction of IFN-alpha/beta genes via the virus-activated, MyD88-independent pathway and the TLR-activated, MyD88-dependent pathway. Viral induction of MyD88-independent IFN-alpha/beta genes is severely impaired in Irf7-/- fibroblasts. Consistently, Irf7-/- mice are more vulnerable than Myd88-/- mice to viral infection, and this correlates with a marked decrease in serum IFN levels, indicating the importance of the IRF-7-dependent induction of systemic IFN responses for innate antiviral immunity. Furthermore, robust induction of IFN production by activation of the TLR9 subfamily in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is entirely dependent on IRF-7, and this MyD88-IRF-7 pathway governs the induction of CD8+ T-cell responses. Thus, all elements of IFN responses, whether the systemic production of IFN in innate immunity or the local action of IFN from plasmacytoid dendritic cells in adaptive immunity, are under the control of IRF-7.",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The enhanced IkappaB degradation in cells with increased levels of BCL11B was specific for T-cells activated through the TCR, but not for cells activated through TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) or UV light, and was caused by increased activity of IkappaB kinase, as indicated by its increase in phosphorylation.",

      "evidence": "All living organisms are exposed constantly to microorganisms that are present in the environment and need to cope with invasion of these organisms into the body. The vertebrate immune response can be divided into innate and acquired immunity, with innate immunity being the first line of defence against pathogens. By contrast, acquired immune responses are slower processes, which are mediated by T and B cells, both of which express highly diverse antigen receptors that are generated through DNA rearrangement and are thereby able to respond to a wide range of potential antigens. This highly sophisticated system of antigen detection is found only in vertebrates and has been the subject of considerable research. Far less attention has been directed towards innate immunity, as it has been regarded as a relatively nonspecific system, with its main roles being to destroy pathogens and to present antigen to the cells involved in acquired immunity. However, recent studies have shown that the innate immune system has a greater degree of specificity than was previously thought and that it is highly developed in its ability to discriminate between self and foreign pathogens1. This discrimination relies, to a great extent, on a family of evolutionarily conserved receptors, known as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have a crucial role in early host defence against invading pathogens1, 2. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity, particularly for the induction of a T helper 1 (TH1)-cell response3, 4. This marked shift in our thinking has changed our ideas about the pathogenesis and treatment of cancers, and infectious, immune and allergic diseases. In the past few years, our knowledge of TLR signalling and the responses these receptors control has greatly increased. In this review, we discuss the TLRs, focusing on their signalling pathways.  TLR/IL-1R superfamily: structure and function  The discovery of the TLR family began with the identification of Toll, a receptor that is expressed by insects and was found to be essential for establishing dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis5. Subsequent studies revealed that Toll also has an essential role in the insect innate immune response against fungal infection6. Homologues of Toll were identified through database searches, and so far, 11 members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. The TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins, and on the basis of considerable homology in the cytoplasmic region, they are members of a larger superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). By contrast, the extracellular region of the TLRs and IL-1Rs differs markedly: the extracellular region of TLRs contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, whereas the extracellular region of IL-1Rs contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig. 1a).     Figure 1 |  TLR structure and signalling.  a | Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) have a conserved cytoplasmic domain, that is known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is characterized by the presence of three highly homologous regions (known as boxes 1, 2 and 3). Despite the similarity of the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules, their extracellular regions differ markedly: TLRs have tandem repeats of leucine-rich regions (known as leucine rich repeats, LRR), whereas IL-1Rs have three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. b | Stimulation of TLRs triggers the association of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88), which in turn recruits IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), thereby allowing the association of IRAK1. IRAK4 then induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1. TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) is also recruited to the receptor complex, by associating with phosphorylated IRAK1.
