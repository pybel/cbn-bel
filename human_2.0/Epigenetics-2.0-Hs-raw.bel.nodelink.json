Results based on probe-by-probe comparison also showed that CpG islands were more likely to be hypermethylated than hypomethylated in lung tissues of COPD patients (S4 Table). However, when comparing non-CpG island methyl probes, the pattern was very different and the numbers of hyper- and hypo- methylated probes were evenly distributed (S1B Fig. and S4 Table). This different pattern suggested there was no global methylation level difference between COPD and CTRL samples. The main difference between them was methylation levels of CpG islands, suggesting biological importance of methylation of CpG islands in transcription regulation.",

Results based on probe-by-probe comparison also showed that CpG islands were more likely to be hypermethylated than hypomethylated in lung tissues of COPD patients (S4 Table). However, when comparing non-CpG island methyl probes, the pattern was very different and the numbers of hyper- and hypo- methylated probes were evenly distributed (S1B Fig. and S4 Table). This different pattern suggested there was no global methylation level difference between COPD and CTRL samples. The main difference between them was methylation levels of CpG islands, suggesting biological importance of methylation of CpG islands in transcription regulation.",

This may be due to HDAC2-mediated transcriptional repression, which prevents transcription from interfering with the repair process. Another possibility is that HDAC2 recruitment influences the ability of DNA repair factors (e.g., Ku70/Ku80) to bind the damaged DNA or to function effectively (82) (Fig. 2).",
