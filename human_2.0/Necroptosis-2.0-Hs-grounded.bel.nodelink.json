      "description": "The Necroptosis network describes the causal mechanisms involved in the activation of the Fas receptor and TNFR1 receptor, leading to RIPK/ROS (reactive oxygen species) signaling and the subsequent induction of necroptosis as a result of exposure to environmental insults. The network includes the array of proinflammatory mediators released from necrotic cells that may contribute to COPD development. \\Reviewed during Jamboree2015"

      "evidence": "Interestingly, HO-1 has been shown to interact with cellular and synthetic proteins, which may modulate the activity of the enzyme. Interactions with amyloid precursor proteins, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, have been demonstrated to inhibit HO-1 activity, resulting in a compromised stress defense (Takahashi et al., 2000; Takahashi and Snyder, 2000; Wagener et al., 2003b). On the other hand, Buelow and colleagues have demonstrated that the synthetic peptide RDP1258 can bind HO-1 and cause increased HO-1 expression and activity in vivo (Cuturi et al., 1999; Magee et al., 1999). This protein has further shown to be highly effective in ameliorating a range of inflammatory conditions (Cuturi et al., 1999; Oberyszyn et al., 2001).  Thus, HO seems to be cytoprotective by limiting the influx of activated inflammatory cells and by ameliorating the extent of cellular necrosis and apoptosis in injured tissues. On the other hand, too high HO-1 expression may also cause tissue injury by the generation of high levels of iron or result in bilirubinemia (Suttner and Dennery, 1999).   V. The Heme-Heme Oxygenase System Top Previous Next   The heme-heme oxygenase system is tightly involved in both physiological as well as pathophysiological processes, such as cytoprotection, apoptosis, and inflammation. A better understanding of the complex heme-heme oxygenase system may provide us with novel tools to combat diverse conditions, such as inflammation, wound healing, transplant rejection, sickle cell disease, and cancer (Lane, 1998; Maines, 2000; Wagener et al., 2003a).  A. The Heme-Heme Oxygenase-1 System and Apoptosis  Under oxidative and inflammatory conditions necrosis and apoptosis may occur, which result in the release of large amounts of heme and subsequently exacerbation of the inflammatory process and cellular injury. However, under these conditions the stress-responsive protein HO-1 will be immediately induced as well.",

Of these four stages, the last two are the least well understood. Quite little is known of how the perpetrators affect the structures and functions and whether and how each of these changes contribute to cell death. According to this description, the key step in ischemic cell death is adequate activation of the perpetrators, and thus a major unifying thread of the review is a consideration of how the changes occurring during and after ischemia, including gene activation and synthesis of new proteins, conspire to produce damaging levels of free radicals and peroxynitrite, to activate calpain and other Ca(2+)-driven processes that are damaging, and to initiate the apoptotic process. Although it is not fully established for all cases, the major driving force for the necrotic cell death process, and very possibly the other processes, appears to be the generation of free radicals and peroxynitrite.",

Release of LDH into the culture medium implying rupture of cell membrane was detected (Fig. 3c). However, we did not detect caspase cleavage activity (data not shown). In line with these findings, necrostatin-1 effectively suppressed BNip3-induced cell death and LDH release while the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK did not (Fig. 3a). At this concentration of caspase inhibitor, cell death induced by Bax overexpression was suppressed (Fig. 3a).

For example, overexpression of this transcription factor protects epidermal keratinocytes or cervical carcinoma cells from ultraviolet radiation (UV)-induced apoptosis [74,75]. In addition, STAT3 deficiency sensitizes keratinocytes to UV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a simple application of a naked STAT3 plasmid on the skin is sufficient to prevent the effect of irradiation. This protective effect was also confirmed in colorectal cancer cell lines where STAT3 inactivation also enhances UV-induced cell death [57]. In multiple myeloma, the aberrant activation of STAT3 has also been shown to confer resistance to FASmediated apoptosis [28]. The inhibition of STAT3 signaling downregulates the expression of survival proteins and restores the sensitivity to cell-death receptors. Furthermore, a constitutively activated form of STAT3 has been shown in vivo to protect liver cells from FAS-mediated apoptosis and necrosis [76]. This has been related to an enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), BCL2, or BCL-XL and a downregulation of FADD-like interleukin-1 b-converting enzyme (FLICE) and caspase 3.",

      "evidence": "Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors 2 and 6 (TRAF2 and -6) act as the ubiquitin E3 ligases to mediate Lys(63)-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys(158) residue in vivo and in vitro. Lys(63)-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys(158) residue is required for TAK1-mediated IKK complex recruitment.....Our findings demonstrate that Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 at Lys(158) is essential for its own kinase activation and its ability to mediate its downstream signal transduction pathways in response to TNFalpha and IL-1beta stimulation.",
