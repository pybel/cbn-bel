      "description": "The Dendritic Cell Signaling network depicts the causal mechanisms in key cytokine pathways leading to the activation of dendritic cells and their migration to both the lung tissue and lymph nodes. Chemokines and surface receptors expressed by dendritic cells that serve to promote T-cell migration and subsequent differentiation in the lung during COPD are included in the network.

Pre-incubation with NAC effectively inhibited the CSE-induced CXCL8 production by DCs (Figure 2C, p<0.001). Pre-treatment of DCs with 2.5mM NAC also significantly suppressed CXCL8 production by DCs stimulated with a combination of LPS and 2% CSE (Figure 2C, p<0.001). In contrast, pre-treatment of DCs with NAC failed to suppress CXCL8/IL-8 generation by LPS-activated DCs. Taken together, these data imply that oxidative stress induced by CSE is an important mechanism by which CXCL8/IL-8 is induced in immature and maturing DCs, whereas nicotinic receptor stimulation is not.",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

      "evidence": "Stimulation with LPS also activates IRF3, and because LPS can induce the expression of both IFN- and IFN-inducible genes in a MyD88-independent manner, this indicates that IRF3 activation does not require MyD88. In fact, IRF3 activation, as shown by dimer formation and nuclear translocation, can be observed in MyD88-deficient cells47.  The activation of IRF3 by signalling through TLR3 is more rapid and potent than that triggered by TLR4 signalling, and this correlates with increased production of IFN- (S.A. and K.T., unpublished observations). Whereas activating TLR3 with poly I:C results in the C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF3, as detected using a phosphospecific antibody, stimulation with LPS does not induce detectable C-terminal phosphorylation70. However, we think that TLR3- and TLR4-mediated IRF3 activation probably differ quantitatively, rather than qualitatively, because it is more plausible that the phosphospecific antibody is not sensitive enough to detect IRF3 phosphorylation following TLR4 activation.  Two IKK-related proteins - IKK- (also known as inducible IKK, IKKi) and TBK1 (TRAF-family-member-associated NF-kB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1; also known as NF-kB-activating kinase, NAK) - have recently been identified as the kinases that phosphorylate IRF3 in response to viral infection and stimulation of TLR3 (Refs 71,72). Overexpression of IKK- or TBK1 activates the promoter of the IFN- gene and of IFN-inducible genes and induces the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of IRF3. In addition, siRNA targeting of IKK- and TBK1, but not of IKK-, was observed to considerably reduce the TRIF-dependent activation of a reporter gene containing an IRF DNA-binding motif and to decrease the viral induction of IFN-4 and IFN- reporter genes71, 72. Furthermore, analysis of TBK1-deficient embryonic fibroblasts confirmed the essential role of TBK1 in IRF3-dependent gene expression mediated by TLR3 and TLR4 signalling73.  NF-kB activation. MyD88-deficient mice still activate NF-kB in response to stimulation with LPS, although the kinetics are delayed compared with wild-type mice. However, the activation of NF-kB in response to LPS is completely abrogated in mice lacking both MyD88 and TRIF, demonstrating that TRIF is essential for NF-kB activation through the MyD88-independent pathway50. Transcriptional activation of the IFN- gene requires activation of both NF-kB and IRF3, and in contrast to inflammatory cytokine production - which requires both early- and late-phase NF-kB activation, mediated by MyD88 and TRIF, respectively - production of IFN- can be induced by TRIF-mediated late-phase NF-kB activation alone (Fig. 4).     Figure 4 |  TRIF-dependent induction of IFN-.  The amino-terminal region of TRIF (Toll/interleukin-1-receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon (IFN)-) interacts with both TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) and TBK1 (TRAF-family-member-associated nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1). TRIF-dependent activation of TBK1 leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3 (IFN-regulatory factor 3), and TRAF6 mediates NF-kB activation. RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein 1) mediates the NF-kB activation that is induced through the carboxy-terminal region of TRIF. Activation of both NF-kB and IRF3 contributes to the activation of the IFN- gene. IB, inhibitor of NF-kB; TLR, Toll-like receptor.",

The best characterized of these is the MyD88-dependent pathway, common to all TLRs except TLR3, which results in rapid activation of the transcription molecules nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B), activator protein 1 and Elk-1 and induction of proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

      "evidence": "All living organisms are exposed constantly to microorganisms that are present in the environment and need to cope with invasion of these organisms into the body. The vertebrate immune response can be divided into innate and acquired immunity, with innate immunity being the first line of defence against pathogens. By contrast, acquired immune responses are slower processes, which are mediated by T and B cells, both of which express highly diverse antigen receptors that are generated through DNA rearrangement and are thereby able to respond to a wide range of potential antigens. This highly sophisticated system of antigen detection is found only in vertebrates and has been the subject of considerable research. Far less attention has been directed towards innate immunity, as it has been regarded as a relatively nonspecific system, with its main roles being to destroy pathogens and to present antigen to the cells involved in acquired immunity. However, recent studies have shown that the innate immune system has a greater degree of specificity than was previously thought and that it is highly developed in its ability to discriminate between self and foreign pathogens1. This discrimination relies, to a great extent, on a family of evolutionarily conserved receptors, known as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have a crucial role in early host defence against invading pathogens1, 2. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity, particularly for the induction of a T helper 1 (TH1)-cell response3, 4. This marked shift in our thinking has changed our ideas about the pathogenesis and treatment of cancers, and infectious, immune and allergic diseases. In the past few years, our knowledge of TLR signalling and the responses these receptors control has greatly increased. In this review, we discuss the TLRs, focusing on their signalling pathways.  TLR/IL-1R superfamily: structure and function  The discovery of the TLR family began with the identification of Toll, a receptor that is expressed by insects and was found to be essential for establishing dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis5. Subsequent studies revealed that Toll also has an essential role in the insect innate immune response against fungal infection6. Homologues of Toll were identified through database searches, and so far, 11 members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. The TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins, and on the basis of considerable homology in the cytoplasmic region, they are members of a larger superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). By contrast, the extracellular region of the TLRs and IL-1Rs differs markedly: the extracellular region of TLRs contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, whereas the extracellular region of IL-1Rs contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig. 1a).     Figure 1 |  TLR structure and signalling.  a | Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) have a conserved cytoplasmic domain, that is known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is characterized by the presence of three highly homologous regions (known as boxes 1, 2 and 3). Despite the similarity of the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules, their extracellular regions differ markedly: TLRs have tandem repeats of leucine-rich regions (known as leucine rich repeats, LRR), whereas IL-1Rs have three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. b | Stimulation of TLRs triggers the association of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88), which in turn recruits IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), thereby allowing the association of IRAK1. IRAK4 then induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1. TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) is also recruited to the receptor complex, by associating with phosphorylated IRAK1.

By rationalizing the shared and unique elements of human and mouse models of cancer, we should be able to identify the molecular circuits that function differently in humans and mice, and use this knowledge to improve existing models of cancer.",

TGF-beta-dependent growth inhibition was specifically attenuated by pharmacological blockade of the TGF-beta type I receptor (TbetaRI) kinase or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, whereas blockade of p42/44 or JNK kinases did not influence the effect of TGF-beta. TbetaRI kinase inhibition blocked all downstream pathways including Smad and p38 phosphorylation",
