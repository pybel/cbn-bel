      "description": "The Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress network depicts the causal mechanisms that regulate endoplasmic reticulum stress including the unfolded protein response and the pathways downstream of the three key stress mediators: PERK (EIF2AK3), ATF6, and IRE1alpha (ERN1). The pro-apoptotic arm of the ER stress response was excluded from this network, but included in the Apoptosis network where the context is more relevant."
