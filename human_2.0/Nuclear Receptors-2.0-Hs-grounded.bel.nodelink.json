Immunoblotting analysis revealed that anisomycin treatment resulted in the slow migration of the expressed GFP-TR3 protein, compared to the GFP-TR3 protein expressed in untreated cells (Fig. 11B). The anisomycin-induced retarded migration of the TR3 protein was prevented when cells were pretreated with a JNK inhibitor. These results suggest that phosphorylation of TR3 by JNK was responsible for the slower migration of the TR3 protein. Similar to full-length TR3, the N-terminal mutant of TR3 (TR3-1-151), which contained the first 151 amino acid residues, was modified by the anisomycin treatment, which was also prevented by the JNK inhibitor (Fig. 11B). In contrast, the migration of TR3/122, which lacks the first 122 amino acid residues, was not affected by anisomycin treatment. These data strongly suggest that TR3 is mainly phosphorylated on the N terminus by JNK. To determine whether phosphorylation of TR3 by JNK affected its DNA binding, a gel retardation assay was conducted to determine the binding of TR3 protein to NurRE before and after its phosphorylation by JNK. As shown in Fig. 11C, bacterially expressed TR3 protein formed a strong complex with the NurRE. However, upon phosphorylation by JNK in vitro, binding of TR3 to the NurRE was largely impaired. In addition, the weak complex formed between TR3 and NurRE migrated slightly faster than that formed by unphosphorylated TR3, probably reflecting a change in TR3 conformation by phosphorylation.",
