      "description": "The Th1/Th2 Signaling network depicts the causal mechanisms that are activated in T helper 1 (Th1) cells following engagement with macrophages including pathways related to the STAT4 and T-bet transcription factors leading to Th1-specific differentiation as well as the causal mechanisms that are activated in T helper 2 (Th2) cells following engagement primarily with B-cells including pathways related to the STAT6 and GATA transcription factors leading to Th2-specific differentiation. The network also encompasses the chemokine pathways involved in mediating T-cell recruitment to compromised lung tissue during COPD development and Th1-produced cytokines that activate cytotoxic T-cells, natural killer cells and macrophages and Th2-produced cytokines that activate B cells, eosinophils and suppress macrophage activation.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eJamboree Review Focus\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eLung memory CD4+ T cell signaling and T-helper cell interaction with other immune cells including T-helper and B cell CD40L-CD40 interaction and NK and Tc activation by Th cells.

Regulated changes in chromatin structure, directed by enhancers and promoter, can modify the availability of recombination signal sequences to the RAG recombinase. Regulated changes in locus conformation may control the synapsis of distant recombination signal sequences, and regulated changes in subnuclear positioning may influence locus recombination events by unknown mechanisms. Together these influences may explain the ordered activation and inactivation of T cell receptor locus recombination events and the phenomenon of Tcrb allelic exclusion.",
