      "description": "The Necroptosis network describes the causal mechanisms involved in the activation of the Fas receptor and TNFR1 receptor, leading to RIPK/ROS (reactive oxygen species) signaling and the subsequent induction of necroptosis as a result of exposure to environmental insults. The network includes the array of proinflammatory mediators released from necrotic cells that may contribute to COPD development. \\Reviewed during Jamboree2015"

Here, using cultured pulmonary epithelial cells and murine models, we demonstrated that CS causes mitochondrial dysfunction that is associated with a reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential. CS induced mitophagy, the autophagy-dependent elimination of mitochondria, through stabilization of the mitophagy regulator PINK1.",

Rather, survival of caspase 8-defective T cells can be completely rescued by loss of receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase (Ripk) 3. Additionally, complementation of a T cell-specific caspase 8 deficiency with a loss of Ripk3 gives rise to lymphoproliferative disease reminiscent of lpr or gld mice. In conjunction with previous work, we conclude that necroptosis in antigen-stimulated caspase 8-deficient T cells is the result of a novel Ripk1- and Ripk3-mediated pathway of cell death.",

      "evidence": "Several studies have further suggested that the upregulation of STAT3 directly confers a drug-resistance phenotype. For example, overexpression of this transcription factor protects epidermal keratinocytes or cervical carcinoma cells from ultraviolet radiation (UV)-induced apoptosis [74,75]. In addition, STAT3 deficiency sensitizes keratinocytes to UV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a simple application of a naked STAT3 plasmid on the skin is sufficient to prevent the effect of irradiation. This protective effect was also confirmed in colorectal cancer cell lines where STAT3 inactivation also enhances UV-induced cell death [57]. In multiple myeloma, the aberrant activation of STAT3 has also been shown to confer resistance to FASmediated apoptosis [28]. The inhibition of STAT3 signaling downregulates the expression of survival proteins and restores the sensitivity to cell-death receptors. Furthermore, a constitutively activated form of STAT3 has been shown in vivo to protect liver cells from FAS-mediated apoptosis and necrosis [76]. This has been related to an enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), BCL2, or BCL-XL and a downregulation of FADD-like interleukin-1 b-converting enzyme (FLICE) and caspase 3.",

      "evidence": "Interestingly, HO-1 has been shown to interact with cellular and synthetic proteins, which may modulate the activity of the enzyme. Interactions with amyloid precursor proteins, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, have been demonstrated to inhibit HO-1 activity, resulting in a compromised stress defense (Takahashi et al., 2000; Takahashi and Snyder, 2000; Wagener et al., 2003b). On the other hand, Buelow and colleagues have demonstrated that the synthetic peptide RDP1258 can bind HO-1 and cause increased HO-1 expression and activity in vivo (Cuturi et al., 1999; Magee et al., 1999). This protein has further shown to be highly effective in ameliorating a range of inflammatory conditions (Cuturi et al., 1999; Oberyszyn et al., 2001).  Thus, HO seems to be cytoprotective by limiting the influx of activated inflammatory cells and by ameliorating the extent of cellular necrosis and apoptosis in injured tissues. On the other hand, too high HO-1 expression may also cause tissue injury by the generation of high levels of iron or result in bilirubinemia (Suttner and Dennery, 1999).   V. The Heme-Heme Oxygenase System Top Previous Next   The heme-heme oxygenase system is tightly involved in both physiological as well as pathophysiological processes, such as cytoprotection, apoptosis, and inflammation. A better understanding of the complex heme-heme oxygenase system may provide us with novel tools to combat diverse conditions, such as inflammation, wound healing, transplant rejection, sickle cell disease, and cancer (Lane, 1998; Maines, 2000; Wagener et al., 2003a).  A. The Heme-Heme Oxygenase-1 System and Apoptosis  Under oxidative and inflammatory conditions necrosis and apoptosis may occur, which result in the release of large amounts of heme and subsequently exacerbation of the inflammatory process and cellular injury. However, under these conditions the stress-responsive protein HO-1 will be immediately induced as well.",

Of these four stages, the last two are the least well understood. Quite little is known of how the perpetrators affect the structures and functions and whether and how each of these changes contribute to cell death. According to this description, the key step in ischemic cell death is adequate activation of the perpetrators, and thus a major unifying thread of the review is a consideration of how the changes occurring during and after ischemia, including gene activation and synthesis of new proteins, conspire to produce damaging levels of free radicals and peroxynitrite, to activate calpain and other Ca(2+)-driven processes that are damaging, and to initiate the apoptotic process. Although it is not fully established for all cases, the major driving force for the necrotic cell death process, and very possibly the other processes, appears to be the generation of free radicals and peroxynitrite.",

      "evidence": "Cells that overexpressed BNip3 began to die 24 h after transfection, and approximately 60% of cells overexpressing BNip3 were dead after 72 h (Fig. 3a). Dying cells were shrunken, and their nuclei were small and condensed without typical apoptotic body formation (Fig. 3b). Release of LDH into the culture medium implying rupture of cell membrane was detected (Fig. 3c). However, we did not detect caspase cleavage activity (data not shown). In line with these findings, necrostatin-1 effectively suppressed BNip3-induced cell death and LDH release while the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK did not (Fig. 3a). At this concentration of caspase inhibitor, cell death induced by Bax overexpression was suppressed (Fig. 3a). These results suggest that BNip3 induces caspase-independent necrosis-like cell death similar to that encountered after treating cells with TNF.",
