      "description": "The Mechanisms of Cellular Senescence network depicts the causal mechanisms that are involved in induction of senescence in non-transformed cells in response to a variety of external stimuli (including replicative senescence, stress-induced senescence, and oncogene-induced senescence). The network includes components that participate in intercellular signaling such as growth factors, chemokines, cytokines and proteases, which ultimately lead to manifestation of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). \\nReviewed during Jamboree2015"

A-Raf, which is structurally similar to C-Raf, is activated in a similar manner; however, the pertinent structural and activational aspects of B-Raf differ from those of A-Raf and C-Raf. Although the structural domains and phosphorylation sites of Raf proteins differ, the greater degree of phosphorylated amino acids in B-Raf confers a 15- to 20- fold higher level of kinase activity in the basal state than either A-Raf or C-Raf, and B-Raf is therefore a much more robust activator of ERK phosphorylation.85,144,145 The differential splicing of B-raf may also account for the distinct kinase activity of the protein. In addition, the structures of several B-Raf mutants mimic the conformational changes unique to phosphorylated wild-type B-Raf, which may explain the ability of B-Raf mutants to activate ERK in the absence of stimulation. Other interactions. In addition to phosphorylation events, the activation status of C-Raf is regulated by protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. As shown in Figure 2, C-Raf interacts with a diverse array of scaffolding proteins (kinase suppressor of Ras and MEK partner-1), adaptor proteins (Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1), chaperone proteins (Hsp90 and Hsp70), substrates (retinoblastoma protein [Rb]), lipids (phosphatidic acid, cholesterol-rich caveolae, and cytosolic lipid rafts), and cellular constituents, many of which, in turn, modulate its kinase activity.95 Activation of Downstream Effectors by Raf Activated Raf principally propagates signaling by phosphorylating the two dual-specificity MAPKKs, MEK1 and MEK2 (also referred to as MKK1 and MKK2; Figs 1 and 2). 75 The Raf isoforms are the best characterized MEK1 and MEK2 activators, and all Raf isoforms activate MEK1, whereas only B-Raf and C-Raf activate MEK2.",

Furthermore, treatment with the p38PMAPK inhibitor SB203580 strongly inhibited IL-18-mediated ATF-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). Inhibition of p38MAPK also attenuated p65 phosphorylation (Fig. 5C) and NF-?B-driven reporter gene activity (Fig. 5D). Together, these results demonstrate that IL-18 induced NF-?B activation via p38MAPK activation (Fig. 5).",
