Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

      "evidence": "Previous studies have demonstrated that U937 cells are able to mobilize arachidonic acid (AA) and synthesize prostaglandins in response to receptor-directed and soluble stimuli by a mechanism that involves the activation of Group IV cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha. In this paper we show that these cells also mobilize AA in response to an oxidative stress induced by H(2)O(2) through a mechanism that appears not to be mediated by cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha but by the calcium-independent Group VI phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)). This is supported by the following lines of evidence: (i) the response is essentially calcium-independent, (ii) it is inhibited by bromoenol lactone, and (iii) it is inhibited by an iPLA(2) antisense oligonucleotide. Enzyme assays conducted under a variety of conditions reveal that the specific activity of the iPLA(2) does not change as a result of H(2)O(2) exposure, which argues against the activation of a specific signaling cascade ending in the iPLA(2). Rather, the oxidant acts to perturb membrane homeostasis in a way that the enzyme susceptibility/accessibility to its substrate increases, and this results in altered fatty acid release. In support of this view, not only AA, but also other fatty acids, were found to be liberated in an iPLA(2)-dependent manner in the H(2)O(2)-treated cells. Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of the iPLA(2) in modulating homeostatic fatty acid deacylation reactions and document a potentially important route under pathophysiological conditions for increasing free fatty acid levels during oxidative stress.",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453].

      "evidence": "Free radicals and other ROS are generated by all aerobic cells and are known to participate in a wide variety of deleterious reactions [1]. A number of studies have also demonstrated that bursts of oxidant production as well as dramatic changes in the activities of various antioxidant defenses are closely associated with alterations in gene expression in a variety of tissues from phylogenetically diverse organisms [1-3]. Free radical reactions have been observed to influence molecular and biochemical processes and to directly cause some of the changes observed in cells during differentiation, aging, and transformation [3-9]. These observations have been interpreted to suggest that cells evolved strategies to utilize ROS as biological stimuli [2,8 -11]. Furthermore, ROS and antioxidants are known to influence the expression of a number of genes and signal transduction pathways [1,12-17] and are thought to act as subcellular messengers for certain growth factors [11,13,18,19]. Indeed, the last decade has seen rapid if not explosive growth in the number of genes shown to be influenced by redox changes as well in as those that exert downstream effects through increased ROS formation. This review article is intended to provide a convenient summary of known redox effects on gene expression. Because nearly half of the effects discussed involve members of the MAP kinase and NF-kB signaling pathways or genes regulated by these pathways, a detailed discussion of these signal transduction pathways is also presented. Although we have intentionally kept our overview brief, we include a short discussion of the various species and tissue-specific differences in redox effects that are known to exist as well a summary of the molecular basis of some of these differences. Cell state transitions leading to transformation, differentiation, and senescence tend to cause large changes in cellular redox state. Our discussion concludes with a brief overview of potential consequences of redox changes for signaling pathways during the cellular transitions. OXIDANTS AND ANTIOXIDANTS MODULATE GENE EXPRESSION A number of genes and cellular pathways are now thought to be regulated by variations in cellular redox status. Identification of redox-sensitive genes and pathways has culminated from a number of independent studies and multiple strategies of detection. Changes in cellular redox state can modulate transcriptional activation of collagen [20] and collagenase [21], post-transcriptional control of ferritin [22,23], and activation of transcription factors such as Myb [24] and Egr-1 [25] as well as the binding activity of the fos/jun (AP-1) protein conjugate [9,26]. Several proto-oncogenes are known to be transcriptionally activated by increased cellular oxidation. For example, exposure of both normal and transformed cells to UV radiation or to H2O2 stimulates increased expression of jun-B, jun-D, c-fos, and fos-B [27-34]. Extensive analysis of this effect by several laboratories has revealed that the influence of H2O2 treatment on c-fos as well as on other early response genes such as c-jun and c-myc is to some extent mediated by PKC [27,29,30,32,35,36]. Presently, the exact sequence of events leading to induction of c-fos transcription after an oxidizing stimulus remains unclear. H2O2 has been used frequently as an oxidative stimulus to identify redox-sensitive genes. For example, Crawford and his colleagues [37-40] used differential display to isolate a number of oxidation-sensitive genes (the so-called 'adapt genes') from hamster fibroblasts treated with H2O2. Although the identity of some of these genes remains unknown, adapt 66 was found to be a homologue of mafG [38], adapt 73 is homologous with a cardiac shock response gene (PigHep3) [41], and adapt 78 is a critical gene associated with Down's syndrome [40]. A specific protein tyrosine-phosphatase has been isolated from H2O2-stimulated human cells...",

Results indicate that C2-ceramide but not inactive C2-dihydroceramide, was found to specifically activate a mitochondrial PP2A, which rapidly and completely induced Bcl2 dephosphorylation and correlated closely with ceramide-induced cell death",

Treatment with fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, and myriocin, an inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase {SPTLC1, SPTLC2}, but not chlorpromazine and desprimine, inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase, inhibited etoposide-induced cell apoptosis (Figure 4B), thus indicating a requirement for de novo ceramide generation. Furthermore, we demonstrated the increased expression of Txnip by etoposide (Figure 4C)",

This ROS response was sensitive to inhibition by diphenyleneiodonium, apocynin, and neopterin, suggestive of an involvement of NADPH oxidases. In line with this, hepatocytes expressed mRNAs not only of the phagocyte gp91phox (Nox 2), but also of the homologs Nox 1 and 4 and Duox 1 and 2, as well as the regulatory subunit p47phox. gp91phox (Nox 2) and p47phox were also identified at the protein level in rat hepatocytes. CD95L induced within 1 min ceramide formation and serine phosphorylation of p47phox, which was sensitive to inhibitors of sphingomyelinase and protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta). These inhibitors and p47phox protein knockdown inhibited the early CD95L-induced ROS response, suggesting that ceramide and PKCzeta are upstream events of the CD95L-induced Nox/Duox activation. CD95L also induced rapid activation of the Src family kinase Yes",

Overexpression of dn-ERK5 strongly suppressed both basal and PMA-inducible SPRR1B transcription, whereas wild-type ERK5 upregulated it. Consistent with this, a mutant form of MEK-5, an upstream activator of ERK5, strongly suppressed PMA-inducible promoter activity.

HSP70 can indirectly control apoptosis using Trx. Activation of Trx regulates intracellular redox-dependent processes, including transcriptional activity, proliferation and apoptosis . Trxâ€“ ASK1 complex pre-exists in the normal unstressed cells andappears to be the target of many extracellular stimuli such as ROS that activate ASK1 by disrupting the Trxâ€“ASK1 complex.",

      "evidence": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is a central pathway that transmits signals from many extracellular agents to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell cycle progression. The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade. Although the main core phosphorylation chain of the cascade includes Raf kinases, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 (ERKs) and RSKs, other alternatively spliced forms and distinct components exist in the different tiers, and participate in ERK signaling under specific conditions. These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Understanding of these processes may provide a full picture of the distinct, and even opposing cellular processes that are regulated by the ERK cascade.",

We pretreated PAEC with SB203580 and observed that CO can no longer modulate STAT1 or STAT3 activation (Fig. 2D, lane 5). Consistent with our data that PI3K/Akt activation is upstream of p38 MAPK activation by CO during A-R (Fig. 2C), when we blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, CO lost its ability to decrease STAT1 and increase STAT3 activation during A-R (Fig. 2D, lane 4).

Consistent with our data that PI3K/Akt activation is upstream of p38 MAPK activation by CO during A-R (Fig. 2C), when we blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, CO lost its ability to decrease STAT1 and increase STAT3 activation during A-R (Fig. 2D, lane 4).

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

In the SAN and AVN, ACh and Ado share the same pathways for signal transduction. ACh binds to the muscarinic M2 receptor, which is coupled to a \\\"direct\\\" G protein-dependent pathway activating Kir3.1/Kir3.4 (GIRK1/GIRK4) channel complexes. Beside this direct pathway, two other \\\"indirect\\\" channel regulation pathways lead to downregulation of intracellular cAMP. In the first cascade of events, the {alpha}Gi protein subunit inhibits AC activity, thereby reducing the synthesis of cAMP. Inhibition of AC synthesis is viewed as the predominant pathway by which ACh regulates the voltage dependence of f-channels (HCN). The second muscarinic pathway is initiated by the stimulation of the NOS activity and production of NO. NOS activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase (GC), which converts GTP in cGMP. Elevation of cGMP concentration stimulates PDE II-dependent hydrolysis of cAMP, thereby reducing PKA activity. This NOS-dependent pathway for regulation of PKA activity has been proposed to be the major pathway for the muscarinic regulation of ICa,L during pacemaking. In the figure, negative NOS-dependent regulation of Cav1.3-mediated ICa,L and Ist is suggested. It is not known if the SAN IKr can also be negatively regulated by the NOS-dependent pathway.",

Furthermore, berberine attenuated high glucose-induced generation of reactive oxygen species, cellular apoptosis, nuclear factor-kappaB activation, and expression of adhesion molecules, thus suppressing monocyte attachment to endothelial cells. In mouse aortic rings, berberine elicited endothelium-dependent vasodilatations and alleviated high glucose-mediated endothelial dysfunction.

      "evidence": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) can be activated by non-bacterial agonists including saturated fatty acids. However, downstream signaling pathways activated by non-bacterial agonists are not known. Thus, we determined the downstream signaling pathways derived from saturated fatty acid-induced TLR4 activation. Saturated fatty acid (lauric acid)-induced NFkB activation was inhibited by a dominant negative (DN) mutant of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF6, or IkBa in macrophages (RAW264.7) and 293T cells transfected with TLR4 and MD-2. Lauric acid induced the transient phosphorylation of AKT. LY294002, PI3K(DN), or AKT(DN) inhibited NFkB activation, p65 transactivation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression induced by lauric acid or constitutively active (CA) TLR4. AKT(DN) blocked MyD88-induced NFkB activation suggesting that AKT is a MyD88-dependent downstream signaling component of TLR4. AKT(CA) was sufficient to induce NFkB activation and COX-2 expression. These results demonstrate that NFkB activation and COX-2 expression induced by lauric acid is at least partly mediated through TLR4/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In contrast, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT induced by LPS or lauric acid. DHA also suppressed NFkB activation induced by TLR4(CA), but not MyD88(CA) or AKT(CA) suggesting that the molecular targets of DHA are signaling components upstream of MyD88 and AKT. Together, these results suggest that saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids reciprocally modulate the activation of TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathways involving MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 and PI3K/AKT, and further suggest a possibility that TLR4-mediated target gene expression and cellular responses are also differentially modulated by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.",

Uric acid and its oxidation product allantoin act as potent antioxidants and free radical scavengers, necessary to protect a cell from oxidative damage caused by numerous naturally occurring ROS and RNS [7, 8 and 9]. XOR has, therefore, important functions as a cellular defense enzyme against oxidative stress. Interestingly, XOR itself contributes to the synthesis of numerous ROS and RNS [1, 2, 5 and 6]. XOR exists in two forms, as xanthine dehydrogenase (XD; EC 1.1.1.204), which is the primary gene product of XOR, and as xanthine oxidase (XO; EC 1.1.3.22), which is formed through post-translational modifications of XD. XD favors the cofactor NAD+ as its primary electron acceptor, yet XO is unable to bind NAD+ and uses O2 as its electron acceptor. With both forms, but particularly with the XO form, numerous ROS and RNS are synthesized [1, 2, 5 and 6].",

This results in inhibition of Akt activation (pAkt), which may be involved in the growth inhibitory responses seen with PPAR? activation. Decreased Akt activity also can lead to decreased activity of the transcription factor NF-?B. NF-?B is a critical transcription factor in the production of proangiogenic and proinflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, IL-8. Decreased production of these factors would be expected to inhibit recruitment of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, and block tumor angiogenesis. PPAR?-mediated suppression of members of the Snail family of transcription factors, such as Snail, Zeb, or Twist, would lead to derepression of E-cadherin expression and promote the epithelial phenotype, leading to decreased migration and invasiveness. PPAR?-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression in NSCLC has been shown by several investigators. This would result in decreased PGE2 production, which will impact growth. TZDs can inhibit PGE2 production through a PPAR?-independent pathway involving induction of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH). (Figure 2 full text)",
