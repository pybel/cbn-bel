      "description": "The Apoptosis network describes causal mechanisms in several different signaling pathways that are involved in the induction of apoptosis in response to environmental cues. The pathways include ER stress signaling, particularly the PERK-eIF2alpha-ATF4-CHOP pathway, MAPK components that regulate the pro-apoptotic proteins (Bad,Bax, Bim) via PI3K/AKT and JNK pathways, NFkB signaling which induces downstream expressions of anti-apoptotic proteins, PKC-mediated apoptosis, and activation of TNFR1 and Fas receptor leading to downstream signaling of caspase-8. The network also characterizes the transcriptional role of TP53 in apoptosis through the presence of its downstream anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic targets. \\nReviewed during Jamboree2014"

      "evidence": "FIG. 7. The signaling arms of the mammalian UPR diverge to regulate some targets and converge to regulate others. The mammalian UPR activates three signal transducers, ATF6, Ire1, and PERK. 1) Activation of ATF6 leads to increased expression of genes regulated by ERSEs in their promoters including ER chaperones like BiP and GRP94, as well as the transcription factor XBP-1. Activation of Ire1 leads to alternative XBP-1 splicing, which in turn up-regulates XBP-1 specific targets like ERdj4, as well as targets with ERSEs in their promoter. A PERK-dependent target other than ATF4 can influence the activation of the ERSE site by an unknown mechanism, which is indicated by a question mark in the schematics. 2) PERK activation leads to eIF-2{alpha} phosphorylation, which allows the expression of the ATF4 transcription factor that in turn induces GADD34 transcription. There is no evidence at this time for members of the ATF6 and Ire1/XBP-1 pathways to impact on the PERK pathway. 3) Finally, the ATF6, Ire1/XBP-1 and PERK pathways converge to optimally induce targets that include CHOP and Herp. Those targets that are downstream of the PERK branch of the UPR are shared with various other cellular stress conditions like heme deficiency, amino acid deprivation, and dsRNA expression. These stresses all activate an eIF-2{alpha} kinase and as a result induce downstream targets like ATF4 and GADD34, as well as those that are dually regulated by both the shared and the ER stress-specific branches of the UPR, which are represented by CHOP and Herp.",

Phosphorylation of eIF2{alpha} inhibits general protein synthesis by reducing the levels of eIF2-GTP that are required for binding of initiator tRNA to the translation apparatus. Concomitant with lowered protein synthesis, eIF2{alpha} phosphorylation leads to preferential translation of ATF4, a basic zipper (bZIP) transcription activator important for directing transcription of stress-related genes (17?20). Reduced protein synthesis conserves energy and provides the cell time for ATF4 and other stress-responsive transcription factors to reconfigure gene expression slated to alleviate damage elicited by the underlying stress. Other members of the eIF2 kinase family include PEK/Perk (EIF2AK3), whose activity is enhanced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (21, 22); HRI (EIF2AK1), which is regulated by heme deficiency and oxidative stress (23); and PKR (EIF2AK2), which functions in an antiviral pathway (24).{P@S52 is the common phosphorylation site between all 4 kinases and confirmed in Uniprot}",

Binding of IGF-1 activates the IGF-1 receptor (purple), which then recruits insulin-receptor substrate (IRS-1). This leads to the activation of two signaling pathways: the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)- Akt pathway. The PI3K-Akt pathway recapitulates hypertrophy caused by IGF-1 stimulation. Akt1 activity can be modulated either by directly controlling its phosphorylation state or by altering the levels of the lipid that it binds at the cell membrane, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] (orange).

The extrinsic death pathway is initiated by binding of the extracellular ligands, TNFa (tumour necrosis factor-a) or FAS (apoptosis antigen-1) ligand (FASL), to death receptors TNFR1 (TNF-receptor1) and FAS. TNFR1 activation leads to the formation of a TRADD RIP TRAF2 (TNF receptor death domain receptor interacting protein TNF associated factor 2) complex, which signals through the NFkB (nuclear factorkB) survival pathway (blue lines) or the JNK (cJun N teminal kinase)death pathway (black lines). RIP activates procaspase 2 and cleaves BID (BH3 (BCL2 (B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2) homology domain 3) interacting agonist). The TRADD FADD FLICE (TNF receptor death domain FAS associated death domain FADD like interleukin 1b) complex activates procaspase 8, triggering apoptosis through caspase 3 or cleavage of BID to tBID (truncated BID). FAS-mediated death occurs through a FADD-mediated activation of procaspase 8 or DAXX (death-associated protein )-mediated activation of JNK. JNK modifies BID to jBID, allowing its translocation to the mitochondrion and release of SMAC/DIABLO (second-mitochondrialderived activator of caspases). The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated at the mitochondrion by diverse stimuli. Membrane permeabilization is mediated by BH3-only proteins, which sequester and inhibit the supression of BAX (B-cell lymphoma 2-associated protein X) by BCL2, allowing mitochondrial BAX translocation and the release of cytochrome c (Cyto c), SMAC/DIABLO, AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) and HTRA2/OMI (high temperature requirement serine protease 2).",

These observations, coupled with reports showing that Bax causes the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, implicate Bax as a central mediator of the apoptotic process. In this report we demonstrate by subcellular fractionation a significant shift in Bax localization from cytosol to cellular membranes in two human tumor cell lines exposed to staurosporine or etoposide. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that Bax specifically relocalized to the mitochondria. This redistribution of Bax occurred in concert with, or just prior to, proteolytic processing of procaspase-3, activation of DEVD-specific cleavage activity and degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. However, Bax membrane translocation was independent of caspase activity as determined using the broad-range caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. High level overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 prevented Bax redistribution to the mitochondria, caspase activation and apoptosis following exposure to staurosporine or etoposide. These data confirm the role of Bax in mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and indicate that prevention of Bax translocation to the mitochondrial membrane represents a novel mechanism by which Bcl-2 inhibits drug-induced apoptosis.",

A oncogene-derived protein,\nBcl2, confers negative control in the pathway of cellular suicide machinery. A Bcl2-homologous protein, Bax,\npromotes cell death by competing with Bcl2. While Bax–Bax homodimers act as apoptosis inducers, Bcl2–\nBax heterodimer formation evokes a survival signal for the cells. Both Bcl2 and Bax are transcriptional targets\nfor the tumour suppressor protein, p53, which induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA\ndamage.

      "evidence": "Several studies have further suggested that the upregulation of STAT3 directly confers a drug-resistance phenotype. For example, overexpression of this transcription factor protects epidermal keratinocytes or cervical carcinoma cells from ultraviolet radiation (UV)-induced apoptosis [74,75]. In addition, STAT3 deficiency sensitizes keratinocytes to UV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a simple application of a naked STAT3 plasmid on the skin is sufficient to prevent the effect of irradiation. This protective effect was also confirmed in colorectal cancer cell lines where STAT3 inactivation also enhances UV-induced cell death [57]. In multiple myeloma, the aberrant activation of STAT3 has also been shown to confer resistance to FASmediated apoptosis [28]. The inhibition of STAT3 signaling downregulates the expression of survival proteins and restores the sensitivity to cell-death receptors. Furthermore, a constitutively activated form of STAT3 has been shown in vivo to protect liver cells from FAS-mediated apoptosis and necrosis [76]. This has been related to an enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), BCL2, or BCL-XL and a downregulation of FADD-like interleukin-1 b-converting enzyme (FLICE) and caspase 3.",

      "evidence": "Several studies have further suggested that the upregulation of STAT3 directly confers a drug-resistance phenotype. For example, overexpression of this transcription factor protects epidermal keratinocytes or cervical carcinoma cells from ultraviolet radiation (UV)-induced apoptosis [74,75]. In addition, STAT3 deficiency sensitizes keratinocytes to UV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a simple application of a naked STAT3 plasmid on the skin is sufficient to prevent the effect of irradiation. This protective effect was also confirmed in colorectal cancer cell lines where STAT3 inactivation also enhances UV-induced cell death [57]. In multiple myeloma, the aberrant activation of STAT3 has also been shown to confer resistance to FASmediated apoptosis [28]. The inhibition of STAT3 signaling downregulates the expression of survival proteins and restores the sensitivity to cell-death receptors. Furthermore, a constitutively activated form of STAT3 has been shown in vivo to protect liver cells from FAS-mediated apoptosis and necrosis [76]. This has been related to an enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), BCL2, or BCL-XL and a downregulation of FADD-like interleukin-1 b-converting enzyme (FLICE) and caspase 3.",

      "evidence": "To explore this further, we have blocked endogenous ErbB3 transcription, thereby engineering tumor cells with overexpressed, fully active ErbB2 but lacking ErbB3 (T. Holbro and N.E. Hynes, unpublished data). As a consequence, these cells have decreased PI-3K/PKB signaling, a reduction in D-type cyclin levels, and show an increase in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A main effector of ErbB signaling, the PI-3K/PKB pathway, is particularly important in mediating cell survival 103 T. Holbro et al. / Experimental Cell Research 284 (2003) 99-110 since several PKB substrates directly control various apoptotic processes. The proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad, when phosphorylated by PKB [93], is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to inhibit survival proteins like Bcl-XL on the mitochondria [94]. In normal mammary cells, blocking ErbB1 activity leads to apoptosis by lowering phospho-Bad levels, [95], a characteristic that would be extremely desirable to retain in cancer cells. Another PKB target is caspase-9, whose activation is blocked by phosphorylation [96] Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, when phosphorylated by PKB, are retained in the cytoplasm and are unable to stimulate expression of several critical genes for apoptosis, including FasL, BIM, and others (reviewed by Brunet et al. [97]). Moreover, PKB phosphorylates IKK-alpha, which in turn inactivates IkappaB, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor upregulates levels of the prosurvival Bcl-XL protein and several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (reviewed by Datta et al. [98]). In this regard, it has been reported that cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis through a PKB/NF-B pathway [99]. Another ErbB effector protein, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (Stat) has been implicated in survival of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. ErbB1, activated as a result of autocrine TGF-alpha expression in tumor cells, constitutively activates Stat3 [100]. Blocking Stat3 in vivo is associated with decreased level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and increased tumor cell death [101].",

Although MYC stimulates apoptosis by regulating many different genes (39, 40), MYC-stimulated expression of BIM is particularly relevant for repression of tumor development (41). BIM functions as a tumor suppressor, at least in MYC-driven B cell leukemia. This is independent of the status of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway that is viewed as an important mediator of MYC-induced apoptosis (39, 40).",

We investigated the antiapoptotic mechanism of Survivin, as well as its expression in 60 human tumor cell lines used for the National Cancer Institute's anticancer drug screening program. In cotransfection experiments, cell death induced by Bax or Fas (CD 95) was partially inhibited (mean ± SD, 65% ± 8%) by Survivin, whereas XIAP, another IAP family member, almost completely blocked cell death (93% ± 4%) under the same conditions. Survivin and XIAP also protected 293 cells from apoptosis induced by overexpression of procaspase-3 and -7 and inhibited the processing of these zymogens into active caspases. In vitro binding experiments indicated that, like other IAP-family proteins, Survivin binds specifically to the terminal effector cell death proteases, caspase-3 and -7, but not to the proximal initiator protease caspase-8. Using a cell-free system in which cytosolic extracts were derived from control- or Survivin-transfected cells and where caspases were activated either by addition of cytochrome c and dATP or by adding recombinant active caspase-8, Survivin was able to substantially reduce caspase activity, as measured by cleavage of a tetrapeptide substrate, AspGluValAsp-aminofluorocoumarin. Similar results were obtained in intact cells when Survivin was overexpressed by gene transfection and caspase activation was induced by the anticancer drug etoposide. Survivin was expressed in all 60 cancer cell lines analyzed, with highest levels in breast and lung cancers and lowest levels in renal cancers. These findings indicate that Survivin, which is commonly expressed in human tumor cell lines, can bind the effector cell death proteases caspase-3 and -7 in vitro and inhibits caspase activity and cell death in cells exposed to diverse apoptotic stimuli. Although quantitative differences may exist, these observations suggest commonality in the mechanisms used by IAP-family proteins to suppress apoptosis.",

The protein is strongly expressed in the most common human neoplasms, has prognostic relevance for some of them and appears to be involved in tumor cell resistance to anticancer agents and ionizing radiation. On the basis of these findings, survivin has been proposed as an attractive target for new anticancer interventions. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated that down-regulation of survivin expression or function, accomplished by means of various strategies, reduced tumor growth potential, increased the apoptotic rate and sensitized tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation in different human tumor models. Moreover, the first survivin inhibitors recently entered clinical trials. Recent studies suggest a possible role for survivin in regulating the function of normal adult cells. However, the expression and function of survivin in normal tissues are still not well characterized and understood. Better knowledge of the role of survivin in tumor versus normal cells will be instrumental for the design of optimal strategies to selectively disrupt survivin in cancer.",

IAP molecules are characterized by both the presence of a zinc-binding fold termed the baculoviral IAP repeat and the ability to suppress apoptosis. In addition to inhibiting apoptosis, survivin is essential for proper cell division. Survivin is expressed during embryonal development but is absent in most normal, terminally differentiated tissues. Survivin is also upregulated in a variety of human cancers, and its expression in tumors is associated with a more aggressive phenotype, shorter survival times, and a decreased response to chemotherapy. The exact mechanism behind the ability of survivin to inhibit apoptosis is still unclear. Furthermore, it is not known why this protein is upregulated in cancer. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current knowledge of survivin, including its role in cell division and its expression in normal and neoplastic tissues. Although much of the current research in this field is focused on human medicine, this area also has potential significance for veterinary species.",

Functioning simultaneously during cell division and apoptosis inhibition, survivin plays a pivotal role in determining cell survival. Survivin has consistently been identified by molecular profiling analysis to be associated with higher tumor grade, more advanced disease, abbreviated survival, accelerated rates of recurrence, and chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Survivin's differential expression in cancer compared to normal tissue and its role as a nodal protein in a number of cellular pathways make it a highly flexible therapeutic target, suitable for small-molecule inhibitiors, molecular antagonists, and vaccination-based therapies. By targeting survivin it is hoped that multiple tumor signaling circuitries may be simultaneously disabled. This effect may be applicable to many tumor histologies irrespective of specific genetic makeup. To date, survivin inhibitors have shown modest activity as single agents, but it is anticipated that when given in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies they may exhibit enhanced efficacy. This review discusses the complex circuitry of survivin in human cancers and highlights clinical trials involving novel agents that target this important protein.",

      "evidence": "Several studies have further suggested that the upregulation of STAT3 directly confers a drug-resistance phenotype. For example, overexpression of this transcription factor protects epidermal keratinocytes or cervical carcinoma cells from ultraviolet radiation (UV)-induced apoptosis [74,75]. In addition, STAT3 deficiency sensitizes keratinocytes to UV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a simple application of a naked STAT3 plasmid on the skin is sufficient to prevent the effect of irradiation. This protective effect was also confirmed in colorectal cancer cell lines where STAT3 inactivation also enhances UV-induced cell death [57]. In multiple myeloma, the aberrant activation of STAT3 has also been shown to confer resistance to FASmediated apoptosis [28]. The inhibition of STAT3 signaling downregulates the expression of survival proteins and restores the sensitivity to cell-death receptors. Furthermore, a constitutively activated form of STAT3 has been shown in vivo to protect liver cells from FAS-mediated apoptosis and necrosis [76]. This has been related to an enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), BCL2, or BCL-XL and a downregulation of FADD-like interleukin-1 b-converting enzyme (FLICE) and caspase 3.",

DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) is a heterodimeric protein of 40-kD (DFFB) and 45-kD (DFFA) subunits. DFFA is the substrate for caspase-3 and triggers DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. DFF becomes activated when DFFA is cleaved by caspase-3. The cleaved fragments of DFFA dissociate from DFFB, the active component of DFF. DFFB has been found to trigger both DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation during apoptosis. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene, but the biological validity of some variants has not been determined.",

For example, overexpression of this transcription factor protects epidermal keratinocytes or cervical carcinoma cells from ultraviolet radiation (UV)-induced apoptosis [74,75]. In addition, STAT3 deficiency sensitizes keratinocytes to UV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a simple application of a naked STAT3 plasmid on the skin is sufficient to prevent the effect of irradiation. This protective effect was also confirmed in colorectal cancer cell lines where STAT3 inactivation also enhances UV-induced cell death [57]. In multiple myeloma, the aberrant activation of STAT3 has also been shown to confer resistance to FASmediated apoptosis [28]. The inhibition of STAT3 signaling downregulates the expression of survival proteins and restores the sensitivity to cell-death receptors. Furthermore, a constitutively activated form of STAT3 has been shown in vivo to protect liver cells from FAS-mediated apoptosis and necrosis [76]. This has been related to an enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), BCL2, or BCL-XL and a downregulation of FADD-like interleukin-1 b-converting enzyme (FLICE) and caspase 3.",

      "evidence": "Figure 3 | Neuronal anti-apoptotic brakes upstream of mitochondria. Black lines represent apoptotic pathways,blue lines represent survival pathways and red lines indicate inhibition or activation (arrows). TNF? (tumour necrosis factor-?)- and FASL (apoptosis antigen-1 (FAS) ligand) mediated death can be suppressed by sequestration by decoy receptors; FASL can bind to DCR3 (decoy receptor 3) or FDR (FAS decoy receptor), or to MET3, a HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) receptor,resulting in no downstream signalling. TNFR2 (tumour necrosis factor receptor 2) can be cleaved by metalloproteases into a soluble decoy receptor for TNF?, and TNF? signalling through the TNFR1 RIP TRAF2 (TNF receptor 1 receptor interacting protein TNF receptor associated factor 2) complex is inhibited by FLIP (FLICE-inhibitory protein), IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) and HSP90 (heat shock protein 90). FLIP also prevents recruitment of procaspase 8 to FADD (FAS-associated death domain), inhibiting apoptosis by the TNFa FADD and Fas FADD pathways. Activation of procaspase 8 to caspase 8 is inhibited by BCL2 (B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2) and APC (activated protein C), preventing cleavage of BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist) to tBID (truncated BID). tBID translocation to the mitochondrion is prevented by stabilization of the cytoskeletal networks by HSP27 (heat shock protein 27). FAS-associated phosphatase-1 (FAP1) prevents binding of FADD and DAXX (death-associated protein) to FAS, and HSP27 inhibits DAXX-mediated activation of ASK1 (apoptosis signal regulated kinase-1) and the JNK (c-Jun-N-teminal kinase)-death pathway. JNK activity is inhibited by HSP70 and its co-chaperone HSP40, and by the IAPs NIAP (neuronal IAP) and XIAP (X-chromosome linked IAP), with XIAP in a complex with its binding partners TAK1 (TGF?-activated kinase) and TAB1 (TAK1-binding protein). ER (endoplasmic reticulum)- mediated apoptosis is inhibited by ORP150 (oxygen regulated protein 150), which prevents activation of calcium-dependent proteases, and by BCL2 and BAR (bifunctional apoptosis regulator)-mediated suppression of BAP31 (B-cell receptorassociated protein 31). IAP proteins negatively regulate pro-death p75NTR (p75 neurotrophin receptor) signalling through NRAGE (neurotrophin receptor interacting MAGE homologue), preventing signalling through the JNK-death pathway. XIAP mediates survival (blue lines) by binding to the cytoplasmic domain of BMP (bone morphogenic protein) receptors, which recruit TAB1 and TAK1 to activate the NF-?B (nuclear factor-?B) survival pathway. IAPs, HSP27 and HSP90 bind to AKT/PKB (protein kinase B) to promote the AKT survival pathway (blue lines).

XIAP, a ubiquitous IAP, can inhibit both caspase-9, the initiator caspase of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and the downstream effector caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. Smac neutralizes XIAP inhibition of caspase-9 by competing for binding of the BIR3 domain of XIAP with caspase-9, whereas how Smac liberates effector caspases from XIAP inhibition is not clear. It is generally believed that binding of Smac with IAP generates a steric hindrance that prevents XIAP from inhibiting effector caspases, and therefore small molecule mimics of Smac are not able to reverse inhibition of the effector caspases. Surprisingly, we show here that binding of a dimeric Smac N-terminal peptide with the BIR2 domain of XIAP effectively antagonizes inhibition of caspase-3 by XIAP. Further, we defined the dynamic and cooperative interaction of Smac with XIAP: binding of Smac with the BIR3 domain anchors the subsequent binding of Smac with the BIR2 domain, which in turn attenuates the caspase-3 inhibitory function of XIAP. We also show that XIAP homotrimerizes via its C-terminal Ring domain, making its inhibitory activity toward caspase-3 more susceptible to Smac.",

Here we show that Smac/DIABLO, a mammalian functional homolog of Reaper/Hid/Grim, selectively causes the rapid degradation of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 but not XIAP and Livin in HeLa cells, although it efficiently promotes the auto-ubiquitination of them all. Smac binding to c-IAP via its N-terminal IAP-binding motif is the prerequisite for this effect, which is further supported by the findings that Smac N-terminal peptide is sufficient to enhance c-IAP1 ubiquitination, and Smac no longer promotes the ubiquitination of mutant c-IAP1 lacking all three baculovirus IAP repeat domains. In addition, different IAPs require the same ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a and UbcH6 for their ubiquitination. Taken together, Smac may serve as a key molecule in vivo to selectively reduce the protein level of c-IAPs through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway.",

The Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) family hosts conserved proteins in the apoptotic pathway whose over-expression, frequently found in tumours, potentiates survival and resistance to anticancer agents. In humans, IAPs comprise eight members hosting one or more structural Baculoviral IAP Repeat (BIR) domains. Cellular IAPs (cIAP1 and 2) indirectly inhibit caspase-8 activation, and regulate both the canonical and the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways. In contrast to cIAPs, XIAP (X chromosome-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein) inhibits directly the effector caspases-3 and -7 through its BIR2 domain, and initiator caspase-9 through its BIR3 domain; molecular docking studies suggested that Smac/DIABLO antagonizes XIAP by simultaneously targeting both BIR2 and BIR3 domains. Here we report analytical gel filtration, crystallographic and SAXS experiments on cIAP1-BIR3, XIAP-BIR3 and XIAP-BIR2BIR3 domains, alone and in the presence of compound 9a, a divalent homodimeric Smac mimetic. 9a is shown to bind two BIR domains inter- (in the case of two BIR3) and intra-molecularly (in the case of XIAP-BIR2BIR3), with higher affinity for cIAP1-BIR3, relative to XIAP-BIR3. Despite the different crystal lattice packing, 9a maintains a right handed helical conformation in both cIAP1-BIR3 and XIAP-BIR3 crystals, that is likely conserved in solution as shown by SAXS data. Our structural results demonstrate that the 9a linker length, its conformational degrees of freedom and its hydrophobicity, warrant an overall compact structure with optimal solvent exposure of its two active moieties for IAPs binding. Our results show that 9a is a good candidate for pre-clinical and clinical studies, worth of further investigations in the field of cancer therapy.",

The substrate-dependent E3 activity of cIAPs is mediated by their RING domains and is dependent on the specific interactions between cIAPs and Smac. Similarly, Drosophila IAP1 also possesses ubiquitin ligase activity that mediates the degradation of the Drosophila apoptosis inducers Grim and HID.

      "evidence": "X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), the most potent member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, plays a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis. XIAP is structurally characterized by three baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains that mediate binding to and inhibition of caspases and a RING domain that confers ubiquitin ligase activity. The caspase inhibitory activity of XIAP can be eliminated by the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac)/direct IAP-binding protein with low pI (DIABLO) during apoptosis. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel isoform of Smac/DIABLO named Smac3, which is generated by alternative splicing of exon 4. Smac3 contains an NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence required for mitochondrial targeting of Smac3 and an IAP-binding motif essential for Smac3 binding to XIAP. Smac3 is released from mitochondria into the cytosol in response to apoptotic stimuli, where it interacts with the second and third BIR domains of XIAP. Smac3 disrupts processed caspase-9 binding to XIAP, promotes caspase-3 activation, and potentiates apoptosis. Strikingly, Smac3, but not Smac/DIABLO, accelerates XIAP auto-ubiquitination and destruction. Smac3-stimulated XIAP ubiquitination is contingent upon the physical association of XIAP with Smac3 and an intact RING domain of XIAP. Smac3-accelerated XIAP destabilization is, at least in part, attributed to its ability to enhance XIAP ubiquitination. Our study demonstrates that Smac3 is functionally additive to, but independent of, Smac/DIABLO.",

We demonstrate that exposure of MCF-7 cells to the death-inducing ligand, TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), results in rapid Smac release from mitochondria, which occurs before or in parallel with loss of cytochrome c. Smac release is inhibited by Bcl-2/Bcl-xL or by a pan-caspase inhibitor demonstrating that this event is caspase-dependent and modulated by Bcl-2 family members. Following release, Smac is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, an effect suppressed by co-treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. As the RING finger domain of XIAP possesses ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and XIAP binds tightly to mature Smac, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed which revealed that XIAP functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) in the ubiquitination of Smac. Both the association of XIAP with Smac and the RING finger domain of XIAP are essential for ubiquitination, suggesting that the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of XIAP may promote the rapid degradation of mitochondrial-released Smac. Thus, in addition to its well characterized role in inhibiting caspase activity, XIAP may also protect cells from inadvertent mitochondrial damage by targeting pro-apoptotic molecules for proteasomal degradation.",

Transiently expressed mature Smac56-239 (called Smac56) and Smac60-239 (called Smac60), which lacks the IBM, interacted with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). However, stable expression produced wild type Smac56 that failed to homodimerize, interact with XIAP, and potentiate caspase activation. Cytosolic Smac60 retained these functions. Cytosolic Smac56 apparently becomes posttranslationally modified at the dimer interface region, which obliterated the epitope for a monoclonal antibody. Cytosolic Smacδ, which has the IBM but lacks amino acids 62–105, homodimerized and weakly interacted with XIAP, but failed to potentiate apoptosis. These findings suggest that the IBM of Smac is a recognition point for a posttranslational modification(s) that blocks homodimerization and IAP interaction, and that amino acids 62–105 are required for the proapoptotic function of Smac.",

IAP function can be neutralized by Smac/Diablo, an IAP-binding protein that is released from mitochondria during apoptosis.

However, it is not known whether the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activities of human IAPs contribute to their apoptosis inhibitory activity or whether this IAP property can be modulated through association with Smac/Diablo. Here we demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase activities of XIAP, and to a lesser extent c-IAP-1 and c-IAP2, are potently repressed through binding to Smac/Diablo. We also show that mutation of the XIAP RING domain rendered this IAP a less effective inhibitor of apoptosis, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase activity of XIAP contributes to its anti-apoptotic function.

However, the impact of Omi/HtrA2 in the apoptotic cell machinery that takes place in vivo under pathological conditions such as cerebral ischemia remains unknown. The present study was monitored in order to examine whether Omi/HtrA2 plays a decisive role in apoptosis observed after focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Male adult rats were subjected to 90min of focal cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion and treated with vehicle or ucf-101, a novel and specific Omi/HtrA2 inhibitor, prior reperfusion. Focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced a mitochondrial up-regulation of Omi/HtrA2 and significantly increased cytosolic accumulation of Omi/HtrA2. Furthermore, ischemia led to activation of caspase-3 and degradation X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Treatment of animals prior ischemia with ucf-101, the specific inhibitor of Omi/HtrA2, was able to (1) reduce the number of TUNEL-positive cells, to (2) attenuate the XIAP-breakdown and to (3) reduce the infarct size. This study shows for the first time that focal cerebral ischemia in rats results in Omi/HtrA2 translocation from the mitochondria to the cytosol, where it participates in neuronal cell death. Blocking the proteolytic activity of Omi/HtrA2 with specific inhibitors, such as the ucf-101, could be a novel way to afford neuroprotection and minimize cellular damage in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.",

Omi release also occurs in apoptotic dying but not in necrotic dying fibrosarcoma L929 cells, treated with anti-Fas antibodies and TNF, respectively. The amino acid sequence reveals the presence of an XIAP interaction motif at the N-terminus of mature Omi. We demonstrate an interaction between endogeneous Omi and recombinant XIAP.

Smac/DIABLO, an inhibitor of XIAP, is released from mitochondria upon receiving apoptotic stimuli and binds to the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP, thereby inhibiting its caspase-inhibitory activity. Here we report that a serine protease called HtrA2/Omi is released from mitochondria and inhibits the function of XIAP by direct binding in a similar way to Smac. Moreover, when overexpressed extramitochondrially, HtrA2 induces atypical cell death, which is neither accompanied by a significant increase in caspase activity nor inhibited by caspase inhibitors, including XIAP. A catalytically inactive mutant of HtrA2, however, does not induce cell death. In short, HtrA2 is a Smac-like inhibitor of IAP activity with a serine protease-dependent cell death-inducing activity.",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The region of X-linked (X) IAP containing the second baculovirus IAP repeat domain (BIR2) is sufficient for inhibiting caspase-3 and -7. In this study, we found that the modes of inhibition of these two caspases were different: caspase-3 is inhibited in a competitive manner whereas caspase-7 inhibition occurs through a mixed competitive and noncompetitive mechanism. Binding assays revealed that the inhibition of caspase-3 by XIAP was totally dependent on the interaction between the active site of caspase-3 and the linker region between the BIR1 and BIR2 domains of XIAP. In contrast, the active site and the NH2-terminal region of caspase-7 bound to the linker region and the BIR2, respectively. Moreover the BIR2 with a mutated linker region, which inhibited caspase-3 very weakly, still bound to and inhibited caspase-7. Furthermore, a chimeric caspase-7/3 comprising the NH2-terminal portion of caspase-7 and COOH-terminal portion of caspase-3 was inhibited by XIAP by a mixed competitive and noncompetitive mechanism. Our results suggest that the linker region between BIR1 and BIR2 domains is responsible for active site-directed, competitive inhibition of both caspase-3 and -7, whereas the BIR2 itself is involved in noncompetitive inhibition of caspase-7.",

Finally, we illustrate for the first time that XIAP mutants, which are incapable of binding to caspases-9 and -3 are completely devoid of anti-apoptotic activity. Thus, XIAP's capacity to maintain inhibition of caspase-9 within the Apaf-1 apoptosome is influenced by its ability to simultaneously inhibit active caspase-3, and depending upon the apoptotic stimulus, inhibition of caspase-9 or 3 is essential for XIAP's anti-apoptotic activity.",

Thus, XIAP's capacity to maintain inhibition of caspase-9 within the Apaf-1 apoptosome is influenced by its ability to simultaneously inhibit active caspase-3, and depending upon the apoptotic stimulus, inhibition of caspase-9 or 3 is essential for XIAP's anti-apoptotic activity.",

Because CASP3/DR cancer cells rely heavily on the activity of caspase-7 (CASP7) to initiate apoptosis, inhibition of activated CASP7 (p19/p12-CASP7) by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a potential mechanism by which apoptosis is prevented in those cancer cells. Here, we identify the pocket surrounding the Cys246 residue of p19/p12-CASP7 as a target for the development of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor of the XIAP:p19/p12-CASP7 complex. Interrupting this PPI directly triggered CASP7-dependent apoptotic signaling that bypassed the activation of the apical caspases and selectively killed CASP3/DR malignancies in vitro and in vivo without adverse side effects in nontumor cells. Importantly, CASP3/DR combined with p19/p12-CASP7 accumulation correlated with the aggressive evolution of clinical malignancies and a poor prognosis in cancer patients. Moreover, targeting of this PPI effectively killed cancer cells with multidrug resistance due to microRNA let-7a-1–mediated CASP3/DR and resensitized cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. These findings not only provide an opportunity to treat CASP3/DR malignancies by targeting the XIAP:p19/p12-CASP7 complex, but also elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying CASP3/DR in cancers.",

These studies failed to demonstrate a role of the BIR2 domain in inhibition. We used site-directed mutagenesis of BIR2 and its linker to determine the mechanism of executioner caspase inhibition by XIAP. We show that the BIR2 domain contributes substantially to inhibition of executioner caspases. A surface groove on BIR2, which also binds to Smac/DIABLO, interacts with a neoepitope generated at the N-terminus of the caspase small subunit following activation. Therefore, BIR2 uses a two-site interaction mechanism to achieve high specificity and potency for inhibition. Moreover, for caspase-7, the precise location of the activating cleavage is critical for subsequent inhibition. Since apical caspases utilize this cleavage site differently, we predict that the origin of the death stimulus should dictate the efficiency of inhibition by XIAP.",
