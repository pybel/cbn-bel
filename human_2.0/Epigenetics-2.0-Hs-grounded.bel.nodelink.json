However, when comparing non-CpG island methyl probes, the pattern was very different and the numbers of hyper- and hypo- methylated probes were evenly distributed (S1B Fig. and S4 Table). This different pattern suggested there was no global methylation level difference between COPD and CTRL samples. The main difference between them was methylation levels of CpG islands, suggesting biological importance of methylation of CpG islands in transcription regulation.",
