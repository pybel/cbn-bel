Administration of the SODm SC-55858, FeTMPS or FeTMPyP at 3 h post LPS reduced the subsequent increase in microvascular leakage, lipid peroxidation and epithelial cell injury.% Our results suggest that O2 and peroxynitrite play a significant role in the pathogenesis of duodenal and intestinal injury during endotoxaemia and that their remoyal by SODm and peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts offers a novel approach to the treatment of septic shock or clinical conditions of gastrointestinal inflammation.",

In contrast, pre-treatment of DCs with NAC failed to suppress CXCL8/IL-8 generation by LPS-activated DCs.

Adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMNs to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells. The oxidants augment NF-ÃƒÅ½Ã‚ÂºB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells and increased PMN migration.

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is known to associate with dectin-1, TLR4 and ITAM receptors and regulate leukocyte cytoskeleton and Fc?R-dependent phagocytosis20-24. Yeast two-hybrid experiments, shown in Figure 3A, demonstrated that Syk can directly bind to the C-terminal domain of TLR4 and that this interaction was mediated by the N-terminal SH2 domain in the Syk molecule. We also found that mmLDL stimulated TLR4 phosphorylation (Figure 3B), suggesting that the mmLDL activation leads to an increased Syk SH2 domain binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues of TLR4. These results agree with our recent findings that mmLDL induced co-immunoprecipitation of TLR4 and Syk in a time-dependent manner as well as TLR4-dependent Syk phosphorylation24. Next, we generated a J774 line expressing Syk shRNA, which had no detectable Syk protein expression. The Syk-knockdown cells accumulated significantly less fluorescent dextran when activated with mmLDL, results fully replicated by the addition of 15LO-CE alone (Figure 3C)",

TLR4-activated CD11b expression was cycloheximide sensitive and involved the activation of transcription factors, NF-kappaB and c-Jun/PU.1. TLR4(-/-) PMNs challenged with LPS were functionally defective as the result of the impaired CD11b expression in that they failed to adhere and did not migrate across endothelial cells in response to N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. TLR4 also promoted increased binding of LPS to PMNs on the basis of expression of CD11b. Thus TLR4 signaling activates synthesis and upregulation of CD11b and is essential for PMN adhesion and transmigration. Our data suggest an important role of TLR4-activated CD11b expression in the mechanism of the PMN host-defense response to LPS.",
