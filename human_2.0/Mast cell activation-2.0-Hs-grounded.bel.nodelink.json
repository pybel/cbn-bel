      "description": "The Mast Cell Activation network depicts the causal mechanisms that occur in mast cells following exposure to antigen and IgE/Fc receptor ligation and stimulation with IL4 and KITLG. The network also includes elements involved in the resulting downstream signal transduction (e.g. Lyn, MEK and MAPK1, and LTC4) that lead to mast cell activation and subsequent release of several cytokines and other factors such as histamine and prostaglandin D2."

Traditionally, it is thought that mast cells bound to Ag-specific Fc?RI, so-called sensitized mast cells, encounter multivalent Ag, and then IgE-bound receptors are aggregated or cross-linked, leading to cell activation (1). Activated mast cells secrete preformed and newly synthesized proinflammatory mediators involved in inflammatory processes of allergy, such as histamine, proteases, lipids, cytokines, and chemokines. The mouse Fc?RI consists of an IgE-binding ? subunit, a signal-amplifying {beta} subunit, and disulfide-bonded two molecules of signal-generating ? subunit (2). Fc?RI aggregation leads to the activation of {beta} subunit-bound Lyn, a prominent Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)3 in mast cells (3). Lyn phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in the ITAMs of the {beta} and ? subunits (4). Phosphorylated ITAMs of {beta} and ? subunits, respectively, recruit Lyn and Syk, a member of another PTK family with two tandemly arranged Src homology 2 domains, leading to the activation of these PTKs. Active Lyn and Syk phosphorylate numerous cellular target proteins, leading to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K and phospholipase C (PLC)-?. An alternative pathway involving Fyn (another Src family PTK) was shown to activate PI3K (5). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers, i.e., diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and then Ca2+ influx. Increased DAG and Ca2+ lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (reviewed in Ref. 6). Both PKC and Ca2+ are required for optimal degranulation (7).",
