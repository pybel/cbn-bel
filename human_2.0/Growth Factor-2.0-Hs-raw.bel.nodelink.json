      "description": "The Growth Factor network depicts the causal mechanisms of common extracellular growth factors involved in regulating lung cell proliferation, namely EGF, TGF-beta, VEGF, and FGF family members. The EGF family members EGF and TGF-alpha play critical roles in regulating the proliferation of airway epithelial cells through EGF receptor activation. FGF7 and FGF10, largely through activation of FGFR2 signaling, stimulate lung epithelial cell proliferation as well as regulate branching morphogenesis in the developing lung. VEGF, a key regulator of normal angiogenesis that is also involved in regulating proliferation of human fetal airway epithelial cells, was also included in the network. \\nReviewed during Jamboree2014"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mice treated with A12 antibody had significantly improved survival after bleomycin injury compared with control mice. Both groups of mice had a similar degree of fibrosis on days 7 and 14, but by Day 28 the A12-treated group had significantly less fibrosis. Delayed treatment with A12 also resulted in decreased fibrosis. A12-treated mice had significantly decreased apoptotic cells on Day 28 compared with control mice. We confirmed that A12 treatment induced mouse lung fibroblast apoptosis in vitro. In addition, IGF-I increased lung fibroblast migration. The primary pathway activated by IGF-I in lung fibroblasts was the insulin receptor substrate-2/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt axis.",

EGFR and ErbB4 had several docking sites for Grb2, while ErbB3 was characterized by six binding sites for PI3K. We identified STAT5 as a direct binding partner to EGFR and ErbB4 and discovered new recognition motifs for Shc and STAT5. The overall pattern of interaction partners of EGFR and ErbB4 suggests similar roles during signaling through their respective ligands. Phosphorylation kinetics of several tyrosine resides was measured by mass spectrometry and correlated with interaction partner preference. Our results demonstrate that system-wide mapping of peptide-protein interactions sites is possible, and suggest shared and unique roles of ErbB-receptor family members in downstream signaling.",

      "evidence": "These findings suggest that different signal transduction pathways as well as cell cycle-specific regulation are controlling the phosphorylation of Ser-62. Indeed RAS signaling that results in the activation of MAP kinases has been suggested to enhance MYC phosphorylation at Ser-62 (31, 32). Phosphorylation at this site appears to affect the stability of MYC at the G0 to G1 transition and to regulate MYC DNA binding (see below). Together these findings promote an attractive model because the RAS signaling pathway is activated by many growth factors and coincides with a strong increase in MYC protein levels upon reentry of cells into the cell cycle. However, because the evidence was derived from cells that overexpressed MYC from recombinant adenoviruses (31, 32), some caution is indicated. The massive overexpression of MYC in resting cells should stimulate cell cycle entry and apoptosis. Also it is not clear whether enough MAXis present in cells to build faithful MYC/MAX complexes. These artificial conditions may severely affect protein behavior, including stability and the response to RAS signaling. It should also be considered that MYC mRNA expression is strongly enhanced upon growth factor treatment of resting cells (6), and the analysis of de novo MYC protein synthesis has revealed a substantial increase in different cell types, including primary cells (33, 34). Thus the contribution of RAS signaling to MYC expression levels at the G0 to G1 transition will need further studying. It should also be noted that the role of MAPK in phosphorylating Ser-62 has been disputed (29). Once Ser-62 is phosphorylated, Thr-58 of MYC becomes a substrate for GSK3 (24). Most substrates of this enzyme must first be phosphorylated by another kinase at a Ser or Thr amino acid four residues C-terminal of the GSK3 site (35). This \\\"priming phosphate\\\" binds specifically into a pocket of the substrate recognition domain of GSK3 and explains why MYC and other substrates require this phosphorylation for the precise positioning of the phosphorylation site. Thus phosphorylation of Thr-58 appears to be strictly dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser-62. Similar findings were made for MYCN (36). Phosphorylation at Ser-54 by CDK1 leads to Thr-50 phosphorylation by GSK3, the two sites correspond to Ser-62 and Thr-58 in MYC, respectively, which enhances MYCN turnover during mitosis in neuronal cells.",

      "evidence": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is a central pathway that transmits signals from many extracellular agents to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell cycle progression. The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade. Although the main core phosphorylation chain of the cascade includes Raf kinases, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 (ERKs) and RSKs, other alternatively spliced forms and distinct components exist in the different tiers, and participate in ERK signaling under specific conditions. These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Understanding of these processes may provide a full picture of the distinct, and even opposing cellular processes that are regulated by the ERK cascade.",

Pretreatment with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 completely blocked GRP-initiated Akt phosphorylation.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mice treated with A12 antibody had significantly improved survival after bleomycin injury compared with control mice. Both groups of mice had a similar degree of fibrosis on days 7 and 14, but by Day 28 the A12-treated group had significantly less fibrosis. Delayed treatment with A12 also resulted in decreased fibrosis. A12-treated mice had significantly decreased apoptotic cells on Day 28 compared with control mice. We confirmed that A12 treatment induced mouse lung fibroblast apoptosis in vitro. In addition, IGF-I increased lung fibroblast migration. The primary pathway activated by IGF-I in lung fibroblasts was the insulin receptor substrate-2/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt axis.",

      "evidence": "These findings suggest that different signal transduction pathways as well as cell cycle-specific regulation are controlling the phosphorylation of Ser-62. Indeed RAS signaling that results in the activation of MAP kinases has been suggested to enhance MYC phosphorylation at Ser-62 (31, 32). Phosphorylation at this site appears to affect the stability of MYC at the G0 to G1 transition and to regulate MYC DNA binding (see below). Together these findings promote an attractive model because the RAS signaling pathway is activated by many growth factors and coincides with a strong increase in MYC protein levels upon reentry of cells into the cell cycle. However, because the evidence was derived from cells that overexpressed MYC from recombinant adenoviruses (31, 32), some caution is indicated. The massive overexpression of MYC in resting cells should stimulate cell cycle entry and apoptosis. Also it is not clear whether enough MAXis present in cells to build faithful MYC/MAX complexes. These artificial conditions may severely affect protein behavior, including stability and the response to RAS signaling. It should also be considered that MYC mRNA expression is strongly enhanced upon growth factor treatment of resting cells (6), and the analysis of de novo MYC protein synthesis has revealed a substantial increase in different cell types, including primary cells (33, 34). Thus the contribution of RAS signaling to MYC expression levels at the G0 to G1 transition will need further studying. It should also be noted that the role of MAPK in phosphorylating Ser-62 has been disputed (29). Once Ser-62 is phosphorylated, Thr-58 of MYC becomes a substrate for GSK3 (24). Most substrates of this enzyme must first be phosphorylated by another kinase at a Ser or Thr amino acid four residues C-terminal of the GSK3 site (35). This \\\"priming phosphate\\\" binds specifically into a pocket of the substrate recognition domain of GSK3 and explains why MYC and other substrates require this phosphorylation for the precise positioning of the phosphorylation site. Thus phosphorylation of Thr-58 appears to be strictly dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser-62. Similar findings were made for MYCN (36). Phosphorylation at Ser-54 by CDK1 leads to Thr-50 phosphorylation by GSK3, the two sites correspond to Ser-62 and Thr-58 in MYC, respectively, which enhances MYCN turnover during mitosis in neuronal cells.",

Furthermore, cotransfection with a construct expressing myristoylated Akt increased NF-kB activity in parental and T691 cells by 4 and 3-fold respectively over the empty vector but no change when expressed with mutant Akt. Stimulation with EGF resulted in the robust activation of NFkB and showed a binding complex,suggesting that  p65/p50 were involved in EGFR-mediated signalling.",

This results in inhibition of Akt activation (pAkt), which may be involved in the growth inhibitory responses seen with PPAR? activation. Decreased Akt activity also can lead to decreased activity of the transcription factor NF-?B. NF-?B is a critical transcription factor in the production of proangiogenic and proinflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, IL-8. Decreased production of these factors would be expected to inhibit recruitment of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, and block tumor angiogenesis. PPAR?-mediated suppression of members of the Snail family of transcription factors, such as Snail, Zeb, or Twist, would lead to derepression of E-cadherin expression and promote the epithelial phenotype, leading to decreased migration and invasiveness. PPAR?-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression in NSCLC has been shown by several investigators. This would result in decreased PGE2 production, which will impact growth. TZDs can inhibit PGE2 production through a PPAR?-independent pathway involving induction of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH). (Figure 2 full text)",

      "evidence": "To explore this further, we have blocked endogenous ErbB3 transcription, thereby engineering tumor cells with overexpressed, fully active ErbB2 but lacking ErbB3 (T. Holbro and N.E. Hynes, unpublished data). As a consequence, these cells have decreased PI-3K/PKB signaling, a reduction in D-type cyclin levels, and show an increase in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A main effector of ErbB signaling, the PI-3K/PKB pathway, is particularly important in mediating cell survival 103 T. Holbro et al. / Experimental Cell Research 284 (2003) 99-110 since several PKB substrates directly control various apoptotic processes. The proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad, when phosphorylated by PKB [93], is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to inhibit survival proteins like Bcl-XL on the mitochondria [94]. In normal mammary cells, blocking ErbB1 activity leads to apoptosis by lowering phospho-Bad levels, [95], a characteristic that would be extremely desirable to retain in cancer cells. Another PKB target is caspase-9, whose activation is blocked by phosphorylation [96] Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, when phosphorylated by PKB, are retained in the cytoplasm and are unable to stimulate expression of several critical genes for apoptosis, including FasL, BIM, and others (reviewed by Brunet et al. [97]). Moreover, PKB phosphorylates IKK-alpha, which in turn inactivates IkappaB, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor upregulates levels of the prosurvival Bcl-XL protein and several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (reviewed by Datta et al. [98]). In this regard, it has been reported that cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis through a PKB/NF-B pathway [99]. Another ErbB effector protein, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (Stat) has been implicated in survival of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. ErbB1, activated as a result of autocrine TGF-alpha expression in tumor cells, constitutively activates Stat3 [100]. Blocking Stat3 in vivo is associated with decreased level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and increased tumor cell death [101].",

We found that although Ser473 phosphorylation was completely abolished in the SIN1-/- cells, Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt was not blocked (Figure 3A). These results indicate that SIN1 is not essential for Akt Thr308 phosphorylation and that the Ser473 phosphorylation is not a prerequisite for Thr308 phosphorylation. Akt, Singly Phosphorylated at Thr308, Remains Active and Functional in Response to Growth Factor Stimulation in SIN1-/- Cells Since Akt Thr308 phosphorylation was not dependent on Ser473 phosphorylation in SIN1-/- cells, we then asked whether this Thr308 singly phosphorylated Akt is still active and whether lack of Ser473 phosphorylation would have a global effect on the phosphorylation of Akt targets. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that Akt retained a substantial amount of enzymatic activity in SIN1-/- cells, although lower than that in wild-type cells (Figure 3B). Thus, singly phosphorylated (Thr308) Akt is an active but weaker enzyme.",

      "evidence": "Beta-catenin is a transcriptional activator that is regulated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). GSK-3 is constitutively active in unstimulated cells where it phosphorylates beta-catenin, targeting beta-catenin for rapid degradation. Receptor-induced inhibition of GSK-3 allows beta-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and then translocate to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1. Wnt hormones, the best known regulators of beta-catenin, inhibit GSK-3 via the Disheveled protein. However, GSK-3 is also inhibited when it is phosphorylated by Akt, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We have previously shown that B cell Ag receptor (BCR) signaling leads to activation of PI3K and Akt as well as inhibition of GSK-3. Therefore, we hypothesized that BCR engagement would induce the accumulation of beta-catenin via a PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 pathway. We now show that BCR ligation causes an increase in the level of beta-catenin in the nuclear fraction of B cells as well as an increase in beta-catenin-dependent transcription. Direct inhibition of GSK-3 by LiCl also increased beta-catenin levels in B cells. This suggests that GSK-3 keeps beta-catenin levels low in unstimulated B cells and that BCR-induced inhibition of GSK-3 allows the accumulation of beta-catenin. Surprisingly, we found that the BCR-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3 on its negative regulatory sites, as well as the subsequent up-regulation of beta-catenin, was not mediated by Akt but by the phospholipase C-dependent activation of protein kinase C. Thus, the BCR regulates beta-catenin levels via a phospholipase C/protein kinase C/GSK-3 pathway.",

No difference was detected (Fig. 5A, left). However, when specific p-ERK activity was examined, significantly higher levels were detected in lung homogenates from patients with emphysema, compared with healthy control subjects (Fig. 5A, right: 1.9 Â± 0.2-fold increase above normal lung, p = 0.02).

The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade.

These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation.

      "evidence": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is a central pathway that transmits signals from many extracellular agents to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell cycle progression. The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade. Although the main core phosphorylation chain of the cascade includes Raf kinases, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 (ERKs) and RSKs, other alternatively spliced forms and distinct components exist in the different tiers, and participate in ERK signaling under specific conditions. These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Understanding of these processes may provide a full picture of the distinct, and even opposing cellular processes that are regulated by the ERK cascade.",

It should be noted that neither of the two adenoviruses affected the expression of the second protein when coinfected in primary cells, as shown by Western blot analysis (Figures 9A and 9B). Because the Gab1YF mutant has been repeatedly shown to have a reduced interaction with SHP2,18,19,36 the results presented in Figure 9C demonstrate that a functional interaction between Gab1 and SHP2 is necessary to explain NO signaling related to increased motility. Moreover, this finding emphasizes that a requirement of Gab1 for SHP2 and of SHP2 for Gab1 is mutual.",

GRP induced release of amphiregulin, and pre-incubation with human amphiregulin neutralizing antibody eliminated GRP-induced Akt phosphorylation. Pretreatment with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 completely blocked GRP-initiated Akt phosphorylation. These results suggest that GRP stimulates Akt activation primarily via c-Src activation, followed by extracellular release of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin, leading to the activation of EGFR and PI3K.",

Ligand binding to ERBB receptors induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of the intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for a range of proteins, the recruitment of which leads to the activation of intracellular signalling pathways. None of the ligands bind ERBB2, but ERBB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for all the other ERBB receptors. ERBB3 has impaired kinase activity and only acquires signalling potential when it is dimerized with another ERBB receptor, such as ERBB2. Overexpression of ERBB2 in tumours leads to constitutive activation of ERBB2, presumably because of increased receptor concentrations at the plasma membrane. Many of these tumours contain phosphorylated ERBB3, which couples ERBB2 to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)?AKT pathway128.",

We found that SU5402 and LY294002 significantly reduced Elf5 expression, whereas U0126 had no effect. LY294002 also reduced Elf5 expression in cultures of purified epithelium. Finally, pAkt was coexpressed with Elf5 in the proximal epithelial airways of E17.5 lungs. These results demonstrate that Elf5 is an FGF-sensitive transcription factor in the lung with a dynamic pattern of expression and that FGF regulation of Elf5 by means of FGFR2b occurs through the PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway.",

Ligand binding to ERBB receptors induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of the intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for a range of proteins, the recruitment of which leads to the activation of intracellular signalling pathways. None of the ligands bind ERBB2, but ERBB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for all the other ERBB receptors. ERBB3 has impaired kinase activity and only acquires signalling potential when it is dimerized with another ERBB receptor, such as ERBB2. Overexpression of ERBB2 in tumours leads to constitutive activation of ERBB2, presumably because of increased receptor concentrations at the plasma membrane. Many of these tumours contain phosphorylated ERBB3, which couples ERBB2 to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)?AKT pathway128.",

We utilised a global proteomics phosphoantibody array approach to identify further c-MET/HGF signal transduction intermediates in SCLC. Strong HGF induction of specific phosphorylation sites in phosphoproteins involved in c-MET/HGF signal transduction was detected, namely adducin-alpha [S724], adducin-gamma [S662], CREB [S133], ERK1 [T185/Y187], ERK1/2 [T202/Y204], ERK2 [T185/Y187], MAPKK (MEK) 1/2 [S221/S225], MAPKK (MEK) 3/6 [S189/S207], RB [S612], RB1 [S780], JNK [T183/Y185], STAT3 [S727], focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [Y576/S722/S910], p38alpha-MAPK [T180/Y182], and AKT1[S473] and [T308]. Conversely, we also identified modest inhibition of phosphorylation by HGF in the following phosphoproteins (Figures 2A and B): PKCa [S657], PKCa/b [T368/641], and PKCd [T505]. Moreover, HGF also inhibited phosphorylation of PKR [T451], which is known to have antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic functions.

We utilised a global proteomics phosphoantibody array approach to identify further c-MET/HGF signal transduction intermediates in SCLC. Strong HGF induction of specific phosphorylation sites in phosphoproteins involved in c-MET/HGF signal transduction was detected, namely adducin-alpha [S724], adducin-gamma [S662], CREB [S133], ERK1 [T185/Y187], ERK1/2 [T202/Y204], ERK2 [T185/Y187], MAPKK (MEK) 1/2 [S221/S225], MAPKK (MEK) 3/6 [S189/S207], RB [S612], RB1 [S780], JNK [T183/Y185], STAT3 [S727], focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [Y576/S722/S910], p38alpha-MAPK [T180/Y182], and AKT1[S473] and [T308].

Moreover, HGF also inhibited phosphorylation of PKR [T451], which is known to have antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic functions.

Ligand binding to ERBB receptors induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of the intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for a range of proteins, the recruitment of which leads to the activation of intracellular signalling pathways. None of the ligands bind ERBB2, but ERBB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for all the other ERBB receptors. ERBB3 has impaired kinase activity and only acquires signalling potential when it is dimerized with another ERBB receptor, such as ERBB2. Overexpression of ERBB2 in tumours leads to constitutive activation of ERBB2, presumably because of increased receptor concentrations at the plasma membrane. Many of these tumours contain phosphorylated ERBB3, which couples ERBB2 to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)?AKT pathway128.",

As shown in Figure 5, wortmannin used at nanomolar concentrations specific for PI 3-kinase inhibition (Arcaro and Wymann, 1993), reduced the human endothelial cells migration induced by VEGF-A165. To determine whether beta3 integrin interferes in PI 3-kinase activation occurring after VEGFR-2 stimulation, we evaluated the effect of BV4 (anti-beta3 subunit mAb) on the phosphorylation in tyrosine residues of the p85 subunit and on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. After pre-incubation with BV4 or with anti-VEGFR-2 Ab for 20 min at 4Â°C, cells were stimulated with VEGF-A165. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 mAb, and the separated proteins by SDSâ€“PAGE were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb.

We found that SU5402 and LY294002 significantly reduced Elf5 expression, whereas U0126 had no effect. LY294002 also reduced Elf5 expression in cultures of purified epithelium. Finally, pAkt was coexpressed with Elf5 in the proximal epithelial airways of E17.5 lungs.

      "evidence": "These findings suggest that different signal transduction pathways as well as cell cycle-specific regulation are controlling the phosphorylation of Ser-62. Indeed RAS signaling that results in the activation of MAP kinases has been suggested to enhance MYC phosphorylation at Ser-62 (31, 32). Phosphorylation at this site appears to affect the stability of MYC at the G0 to G1 transition and to regulate MYC DNA binding (see below). Together these findings promote an attractive model because the RAS signaling pathway is activated by many growth factors and coincides with a strong increase in MYC protein levels upon reentry of cells into the cell cycle. However, because the evidence was derived from cells that overexpressed MYC from recombinant adenoviruses (31, 32), some caution is indicated. The massive overexpression of MYC in resting cells should stimulate cell cycle entry and apoptosis. Also it is not clear whether enough MAXis present in cells to build faithful MYC/MAX complexes. These artificial conditions may severely affect protein behavior, including stability and the response to RAS signaling. It should also be considered that MYC mRNA expression is strongly enhanced upon growth factor treatment of resting cells (6), and the analysis of de novo MYC protein synthesis has revealed a substantial increase in different cell types, including primary cells (33, 34). Thus the contribution of RAS signaling to MYC expression levels at the G0 to G1 transition will need further studying. It should also be noted that the role of MAPK in phosphorylating Ser-62 has been disputed (29). Once Ser-62 is phosphorylated, Thr-58 of MYC becomes a substrate for GSK3 (24). Most substrates of this enzyme must first be phosphorylated by another kinase at a Ser or Thr amino acid four residues C-terminal of the GSK3 site (35). This \\\"priming phosphate\\\" binds specifically into a pocket of the substrate recognition domain of GSK3 and explains why MYC and other substrates require this phosphorylation for the precise positioning of the phosphorylation site. Thus phosphorylation of Thr-58 appears to be strictly dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser-62. Similar findings were made for MYCN (36). Phosphorylation at Ser-54 by CDK1 leads to Thr-50 phosphorylation by GSK3, the two sites correspond to Ser-62 and Thr-58 in MYC, respectively, which enhances MYCN turnover during mitosis in neuronal cells.",

We calculated estimated log ratios, moderated t statistics, log odds ratios of differential expression, and P values for each contrast of interest using functions in the Bioconductor package limma (24).

Ligand binding to ERBB receptors induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of the intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for a range of proteins, the recruitment of which leads to the activation of intracellular signalling pathways. None of the ligands bind ERBB2, but ERBB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for all the other ERBB receptors. ERBB3 has impaired kinase activity and only acquires signalling potential when it is dimerized with another ERBB receptor, such as ERBB2. Overexpression of ERBB2 in tumours leads to constitutive activation of ERBB2, presumably because of increased receptor concentrations at the plasma membrane. Many of these tumours contain phosphorylated ERBB3, which couples ERBB2 to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)?AKT pathway128.",

      "evidence": "Figure 1 | ERBB receptors, ligands, dimers and downstream signalling pathways. a | Members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors are ligands for the ERBB receptors. Ligand binding to ERBB receptors induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of the intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for a range of proteins, the recruitment of which leads to the activation of intracellular signalling pathways. None of the ligands bind ERBB2, but ERBB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for all the other ERBB receptors. ERBB3 has impaired kinase activity and only acquires signalling potential when it is dimerized with another ERBB receptor, such as ERBB2. Overexpression of ERBB2 in tumours leads to constitutive activation of ERBB2, presumably because of increased receptor concentrations at the plasma membrane. Many of these tumours contain phosphorylated ERBB3, which couples ERBB2 to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)?AKT pathway128.",
