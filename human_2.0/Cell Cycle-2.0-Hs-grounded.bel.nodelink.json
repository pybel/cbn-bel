      "evidence": "Various studies, including several microarray expression analyses, have demonstrated that MYC proteins control the expression of many target genes (11-14). The resulting consequences on many different aspects of cell behavior and cell fate demand that this protein is precisely controlled. Too little or too much MYC protein and/or activity may severely affect proper functioning of cells and as a consequence affect their proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which may result in disease. As pointed out above this is most evident in cells that produce too much MYC, which is associated with tumorigenesis. Thus it is not surprising that the expression and function of this protein is regulated at multiple levels. The expression of the MYC gene is regulated by a wide variety of signals that control promoter activity, RNA polymerase elongation, and mRNA processing and collectively determine where, when, and how much MYC is synthesized (6). Here we will focus on mechanisms further downstream that impinge on MYC. The protein is subject to interdependent posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitinylation, suggesting that MYC proteins directly integrate the information of different signal transduction pathways. MYC Is Phosphorylated at Multiple Sites MYC proteins are phosphorylated at multiple sites distributed over the entire protein (Fig. 1). The first and major sites were identified almost 20 years ago within two areas, the acidic domain and near the basic region, and are substrates of protein kinase CK2, an enzyme that has broad biological activities including a role in tumorigenesis (15, 16). Nevertheless the functional relevance of these CK2 phosphorylation sites on MYC has remained elusive. However, in a recent study a correlation between CK2 activity and MYC protein levels was demonstrated, suggesting that CK2 stabilizes MYC(17).",

First, is the presence of a p53 RE in the DNA close to the gene or within the gene. Second, is to demonstrate that the particular gene is upregulated or downregulated at the RNA and protein level by wild-type p53 protein. The third line of evidence is to clone the RE upstream of any reporter gene like luciferase and show that p53 induction can regulate this test gene in the same fashion as the gene of interest. Finally, it has to be established by ChIP using specific p53 antibody, that p53 physically interacts with the RE and binds to the chromatin. In some cases a gel-shift assay is also done additionally to demonstrate the binding in vitro. Here, in this study we have fulfilled all the above criteria and have established the SAC gene Cdc20 to be downregulated by p53 upon DNA damage where activated p53 directly binds to the RE located 689-bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS).",

Ubiquitinylation of p27 requires its phosphorylation at Thr 187 (refs 3, 4) and subsequent recognition by S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2; refs 5-8), a member of the F-box family of proteins that associates with Skp1, Cul-1 and ROC1/Rbx1 to form an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. However, in vitro ligation of p27 to ubiquitin could not be reconstituted by known purified components of the SCFSkp2 complex. Here we show that the missing factor is CDK subunit 1 (Cks1), which belongs to the highly conserved Suc1/Cks family of proteins that bind to some CDKs and phosphorylated proteins and are essential for cell-cycle progression. Human Cks1, but not other members of the family, reconstitutes ubiquitin ligation of p27 in a completely purified system, binds to Skp2 and greatly increases binding of T187-phosphorylated p27 to Skp2. Our results represent the first evidence that an SCF complex requires an accessory protein for activity as well as for binding to its phosphorylated substrate.",

In particular, significant decreases in the expression of pRB/E2F cell-cycle target genes (RRM1, MAD2, BIRC5, HMMR, RRM2, CDC2, CCNB1 and DLG7) were seen in both THAP1 overexpression and knock-down endothelial cells.
