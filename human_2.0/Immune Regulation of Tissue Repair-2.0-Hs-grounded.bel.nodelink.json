      "evidence": "others clearly are not [19, 43]. In fact, the ROS-induced modulation of gene expression associated with DNA repair can occur in the absence of DNA damage [44]. Some of the effects of UV radiation exposure on various pathways are probably stimulated by DNA damage; however, UVA radiation (320-380 nm), which produces little DNA damage, is effective at inducing expression of collagenase [45], heme oxygenase [46,47], ICAM-1 [48], IL-10 [49], cjun, c-fos, and activation of the JNK MAP kinase pathway [50] and at stimulating increases in ferritin protein [51]. Furthermore, exposure of cells to singlet oxygen generation without light exposure stimulates collagenase production [52].  Redox changes that alter gene expression are not limited to increases in oxidation. Antioxidant treatments can also stimulate increases in the expression of certain genes [53-57]. Although it is possible that autoxidation of antioxidant compounds produces enough ROS to stimulate changes in gene expression through oxidizing rather than reducing mechanisms, this seems improbable. Keogh et al. [55] examined several parameters of oxidation in fibroblasts stimulated to increase c-fos abundance with different antioxidant compounds and found no evidence of increased oxidation; albeit, the antioxidant effects observed were small and were manifested primarily as an increase in GSH concentration. It is also possible that secondary effects of chemical treatments rather than their oxidant/antioxidant properties are responsible for the effects on signal transduction and gene expression. This too seems improbable, because oxidants have been used to block the effects of antioxidant compounds [25,33,58,59] and vice versa [11,26,36,60-77] in a number of independent studies. Choi and Moore [78] examined a series of structural isomers of butylated hydroxytoluene and observed that only those compounds with relatively high antioxidant potential are capable of inducing c-fos.",

In contrast, pre-treatment of DCs with NAC failed to suppress CXCL8/IL-8 generation by LPS-activated DCs.

This has important implications since other NF-?B responsive genes including pro-inflammatory cytokines have been found in elevated levels in H pylori infected gastric mucosa. NF-?B activation is known to regulate cellular growth responses, including apoptosis, and is required for the induction of inflammatory and tissue-repair genes, including macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The NF-?B pathway is also responsible for the generation of several cell adhesion molecules including ICAM-1 whose expression is signifi cantly correlated with an increase in H pylori induced gastritis[54].",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441].

A yeast two-hybrid screening, using the Rel homology domain (RHD) of the p65 subunit (RelA) of NF-kappaB as bait, led to the isolation of PIAS3, previously identified as a specific inhibitor of STAT3. We show that PIAS3 can directly associate with p65 using an in vitro pull-down and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays. When overexpressed, PIAS3 inhibits NF-kappaB-dependent transcription induced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin-1beta or by overexpression of TNF family receptors such as RANK, TNFR1, and CD30 or signal transducers of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), including TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6. Downregulation of PIAS3 by RNA interference reverses its effect on TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation. We found that an N-terminal region of PIAS3 is necessary for both the interaction with p65 and the transcriptional suppression activity. In addition, we found that an LXXLL coregulator signature motif located within the N-terminal region of PIAS3 is the minimal requirement for the interaction with p65. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PIAS3 interferes with p65 binding to the CBP coactivator, thereby resulting in a decreased NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that PIAS3 may function in vivo as a modulator in suppressing the transcriptional activity of p65.",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

      "evidence": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is tightly regulated by the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and plays a central role in regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic stress. Metformin has been shown to activate AMPK. We hypothesized that metformin may prevent nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in endothelial cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines. Metformin was observed to activate AMPK, as well as its downstream target, phosphoacetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Metformin also dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB kinase activity. Furthermore, metformin attenuated the TNF-alpha-induced gene expression of various proinflammatory and cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in HUVECs. A pharmacological activator of AMPK, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR), dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced NF-kappaB reporter gene expression. AICAR also suppressed the TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced gene expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in HUVECs. The small interfering RNA for AMPKalpha1 attenuated metformin or AICAR-induced inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha, suggesting a possible role of AMPK in the regulation of cell inflammation. In light of these findings, we suggest that metformin attenuates the cytokine-induced expression of proinflammatory and adhesion molecule genes by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation via AMPK activation. Thus, it might be useful to target AMPK signaling in future efforts to prevent atherogenic and inflammatory vascular disease.",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

(TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

The best characterized of these is the MyD88-dependent pathway, common to all TLRs except TLR3, which results in rapid activation of the transcription molecules nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B), activator protein 1 and Elk-1 and induction of proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

These effects were associated with a significant reduction in apoptosis of freshly isolated IEC as assessed by propidium iodide staining and DNA laddering. In contrast, an increase in lamina propria mononuclear cell apoptosis was observed in anti-TNF-alpha-treated mice compared with control. These results were confirmed in vivo by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-assay. In addition, neutralization of TNF-alpha reduced membrane bound FAS/CD95 expression in IEC from SAMP1/YitFc mice compared with control antibody.",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",
