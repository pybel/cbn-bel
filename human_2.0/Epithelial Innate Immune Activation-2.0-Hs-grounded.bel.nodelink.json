      "description": "The Epithelial Innate Immune Activation network depicts causal mechanisms involved in aspects of the innate immune system that are initially activated in pulmonary epithelium in response to cigarette smoke exposure, and remain in a state of constitutive activation during COPD development. These processes include Toll-like receptor activation and respective pathways leading to subsequent proinflammatory cytokine production by lung epithelial cells."

      "evidence": "Free radicals and other ROS are generated by all aerobic cells and are known to participate in a wide variety of deleterious reactions [1]. A number of studies have also demonstrated that bursts of oxidant production as well as dramatic changes in the activities of various antioxidant defenses are closely associated with alterations in gene expression in a variety of tissues from phylogenetically diverse organisms [1-3]. Free radical reactions have been observed to influence molecular and biochemical processes and to directly cause some of the changes observed in cells during differentiation, aging, and transformation [3-9]. These observations have been interpreted to suggest that cells evolved strategies to utilize ROS as biological stimuli [2,8 -11]. Furthermore, ROS and antioxidants are known to influence the expression of a number of genes and signal transduction pathways [1,12-17] and are thought to act as subcellular messengers for certain growth factors [11,13,18,19]. Indeed, the last decade has seen rapid if not explosive growth in the number of genes shown to be influenced by redox changes as well in as those that exert downstream effects through increased ROS formation. This review article is intended to provide a convenient summary of known redox effects on gene expression. Because nearly half of the effects discussed involve members of the MAP kinase and NF-kB signaling pathways or genes regulated by these pathways, a detailed discussion of these signal transduction pathways is also presented. Although we have intentionally kept our overview brief, we include a short discussion of the various species and tissue-specific differences in redox effects that are known to exist as well a summary of the molecular basis of some of these differences. Cell state transitions leading to transformation, differentiation, and senescence tend to cause large changes in cellular redox state. Our discussion concludes with a brief overview of potential consequences of redox changes for signaling pathways during the cellular transitions. OXIDANTS AND ANTIOXIDANTS MODULATE GENE EXPRESSION A number of genes and cellular pathways are now thought to be regulated by variations in cellular redox status. Identification of redox-sensitive genes and pathways has culminated from a number of independent studies and multiple strategies of detection. Changes in cellular redox state can modulate transcriptional activation of collagen [20] and collagenase [21], post-transcriptional control of ferritin [22,23], and activation of transcription factors such as Myb [24] and Egr-1 [25] as well as the binding activity of the fos/jun (AP-1) protein conjugate [9,26]. Several proto-oncogenes are known to be transcriptionally activated by increased cellular oxidation. For example, exposure of both normal and transformed cells to UV radiation or to H2O2 stimulates increased expression of jun-B, jun-D, c-fos, and fos-B [27-34]. Extensive analysis of this effect by several laboratories has revealed that the influence of H2O2 treatment on c-fos as well as on other early response genes such as c-jun and c-myc is to some extent mediated by PKC [27,29,30,32,35,36]. Presently, the exact sequence of events leading to induction of c-fos transcription after an oxidizing stimulus remains unclear. H2O2 has been used frequently as an oxidative stimulus to identify redox-sensitive genes. For example, Crawford and his colleagues [37-40] used differential display to isolate a number of oxidation-sensitive genes (the so-called 'adapt genes') from hamster fibroblasts treated with H2O2. Although the identity of some of these genes remains unknown, adapt 66 was found to be a homologue of mafG [38], adapt 73 is homologous with a cardiac shock response gene (PigHep3) [41], and adapt 78 is a critical gene associated with Down's syndrome [40]. A specific protein tyrosine-phosphatase has been isolated from H2O2-stimulated human cells...",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

A yeast two-hybrid screening, using the Rel homology domain (RHD) of the p65 subunit (RelA) of NF-kappaB as bait, led to the isolation of PIAS3, previously identified as a specific inhibitor of STAT3. We show that PIAS3 can directly associate with p65 using an in vitro pull-down and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays. When overexpressed, PIAS3 inhibits NF-kappaB-dependent transcription induced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin-1beta or by overexpression of TNF family receptors such as RANK, TNFR1, and CD30 or signal transducers of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), including TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6. Downregulation of PIAS3 by RNA interference reverses its effect on TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation. We found that an N-terminal region of PIAS3 is necessary for both the interaction with p65 and the transcriptional suppression activity. In addition, we found that an LXXLL coregulator signature motif located within the N-terminal region of PIAS3 is the minimal requirement for the interaction with p65. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PIAS3 interferes with p65 binding to the CBP coactivator, thereby resulting in a decreased NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that PIAS3 may function in vivo as a modulator in suppressing the transcriptional activity of p65.",

PARP-1 and p300 synergistically coactivated NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in response to TNFalpha and LPS. Furthermore, PARP-1 interacted directly with p300 and enhanced the interaction of NF-kappaB1/p50 to p300. The C terminus, harboring the catalytic domain of PARP-1 but not its enzymatic activity, was required for complete transcriptional coactivation of NF-kappaB by p300 in response to TNFalpha and LPS. Together, these results indicate that PARP-1 acts synergistically with p300 and plays an essential regulatory role in NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression.",

Although cigarette smoking is thought to be involved in mucus hypersecretion in COPD, the mechanism by which cigarette smoke induces mucus overproduction is unknown. Here we show that activation of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) is responsible for mucin production after inhalation of cigarette smoke in airways in vitro and in vivo. In the airway epithelial cell line NCI-H292, exposure to cigarette smoke upregulated the EGFR mRNA expression and induced activation of EGFR-specific tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in upregulation of MUC5AC mRNA and protein production, effects that were inhibited completely by selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BIBX1522, AG-1478) and that were decreased by antioxidants. In vivo, cigarette smoke inhalation increased MUC5AC mRNA and goblet cell production in rat airways, effects that were prevented by pretreatment with BIBX1522. These effects may explain the goblet cell hyperplasia that occurs in COPD and may provide a novel strategy for therapy in airway hypersecretory diseases",

      "evidence": "All living organisms are exposed constantly to microorganisms that are present in the environment and need to cope with invasion of these organisms into the body. The vertebrate immune response can be divided into innate and acquired immunity, with innate immunity being the first line of defence against pathogens. By contrast, acquired immune responses are slower processes, which are mediated by T and B cells, both of which express highly diverse antigen receptors that are generated through DNA rearrangement and are thereby able to respond to a wide range of potential antigens. This highly sophisticated system of antigen detection is found only in vertebrates and has been the subject of considerable research. Far less attention has been directed towards innate immunity, as it has been regarded as a relatively nonspecific system, with its main roles being to destroy pathogens and to present antigen to the cells involved in acquired immunity. However, recent studies have shown that the innate immune system has a greater degree of specificity than was previously thought and that it is highly developed in its ability to discriminate between self and foreign pathogens1. This discrimination relies, to a great extent, on a family of evolutionarily conserved receptors, known as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have a crucial role in early host defence against invading pathogens1, 2. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity, particularly for the induction of a T helper 1 (TH1)-cell response3, 4. This marked shift in our thinking has changed our ideas about the pathogenesis and treatment of cancers, and infectious, immune and allergic diseases. In the past few years, our knowledge of TLR signalling and the responses these receptors control has greatly increased. In this review, we discuss the TLRs, focusing on their signalling pathways.  TLR/IL-1R superfamily: structure and function  The discovery of the TLR family began with the identification of Toll, a receptor that is expressed by insects and was found to be essential for establishing dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis5. Subsequent studies revealed that Toll also has an essential role in the insect innate immune response against fungal infection6. Homologues of Toll were identified through database searches, and so far, 11 members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. The TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins, and on the basis of considerable homology in the cytoplasmic region, they are members of a larger superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). By contrast, the extracellular region of the TLRs and IL-1Rs differs markedly: the extracellular region of TLRs contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, whereas the extracellular region of IL-1Rs contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig. 1a).     Figure 1 |  TLR structure and signalling.  a | Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) have a conserved cytoplasmic domain, that is known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is characterized by the presence of three highly homologous regions (known as boxes 1, 2 and 3). Despite the similarity of the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules, their extracellular regions differ markedly: TLRs have tandem repeats of leucine-rich regions (known as leucine rich repeats, LRR), whereas IL-1Rs have three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. b | Stimulation of TLRs triggers the association of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88), which in turn recruits IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), thereby allowing the association of IRAK1. IRAK4 then induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1. TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) is also recruited to the receptor complex, by associating with phosphorylated IRAK1.

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

      "evidence": "All living organisms are exposed constantly to microorganisms that are present in the environment and need to cope with invasion of these organisms into the body. The vertebrate immune response can be divided into innate and acquired immunity, with innate immunity being the first line of defence against pathogens. By contrast, acquired immune responses are slower processes, which are mediated by T and B cells, both of which express highly diverse antigen receptors that are generated through DNA rearrangement and are thereby able to respond to a wide range of potential antigens. This highly sophisticated system of antigen detection is found only in vertebrates and has been the subject of considerable research. Far less attention has been directed towards innate immunity, as it has been regarded as a relatively nonspecific system, with its main roles being to destroy pathogens and to present antigen to the cells involved in acquired immunity. However, recent studies have shown that the innate immune system has a greater degree of specificity than was previously thought and that it is highly developed in its ability to discriminate between self and foreign pathogens1. This discrimination relies, to a great extent, on a family of evolutionarily conserved receptors, known as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have a crucial role in early host defence against invading pathogens1, 2. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity, particularly for the induction of a T helper 1 (TH1)-cell response3, 4. This marked shift in our thinking has changed our ideas about the pathogenesis and treatment of cancers, and infectious, immune and allergic diseases. In the past few years, our knowledge of TLR signalling and the responses these receptors control has greatly increased. In this review, we discuss the TLRs, focusing on their signalling pathways.  TLR/IL-1R superfamily: structure and function  The discovery of the TLR family began with the identification of Toll, a receptor that is expressed by insects and was found to be essential for establishing dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis5. Subsequent studies revealed that Toll also has an essential role in the insect innate immune response against fungal infection6. Homologues of Toll were identified through database searches, and so far, 11 members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. The TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins, and on the basis of considerable homology in the cytoplasmic region, they are members of a larger superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). By contrast, the extracellular region of the TLRs and IL-1Rs differs markedly: the extracellular region of TLRs contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, whereas the extracellular region of IL-1Rs contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig. 1a).     Figure 1 |  TLR structure and signalling.  a | Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) have a conserved cytoplasmic domain, that is known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is characterized by the presence of three highly homologous regions (known as boxes 1, 2 and 3). Despite the similarity of the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules, their extracellular regions differ markedly: TLRs have tandem repeats of leucine-rich regions (known as leucine rich repeats, LRR), whereas IL-1Rs have three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. b | Stimulation of TLRs triggers the association of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88), which in turn recruits IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), thereby allowing the association of IRAK1. IRAK4 then induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1. TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) is also recruited to the receptor complex, by associating with phosphorylated IRAK1.

Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and assayed in EMSAs using the kappa-light-chain enhancer high-affinity kappaB site as probe and Western analysis with anti-IkappaBalpha and anti-IkappaBbeta antibodies. BIS caused a slight induction of NF-kappaB/Rel activity at 1 and 5 micromolar but had no effect on basal NF-kappaB/Rel activity at 10 and 15 micromolar (Fig. 5, lanes 3-6). Caerulein-induced NF-kappaB/Rel activity was efficiently blocked by BIS at 5, 10, and 15 micromolar, with the highest dose being most effective. Degradation of IkappaBalpha by caerulein was already sustained by BIS at 1 micromolar and completely blocked by BIS at 5, 10, or 15 micromolar.",
