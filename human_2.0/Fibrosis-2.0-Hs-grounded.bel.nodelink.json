      "description": "The Fibrosis network depicts causal mechanisms that describe fibrosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT) in lung tissue repair, including distinct characteristics of lung fibrosis such as TGFB1, collagen and MMPs. The network also contains signaling components of the Wnt, Hedgehog, and EGFR pathways that promote fibrosis and EMT."

Binding of IGF-1 activates the IGF-1 receptor (purple), which then recruits insulin-receptor substrate (IRS-1). This leads to the activation of two signaling pathways: the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)- Akt pathway. The PI3K-Akt pathway recapitulates hypertrophy caused by IGF-1 stimulation. Akt1 activity can be modulated either by directly controlling its phosphorylation state or by altering the levels of the lipid that it binds at the cell membrane, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] (orange). Signaling molecules that have been shown to have a negative effect on hypertrophy are colored red, and proteins whose activation induces hypertrophy are shown in green. Proteins that have not been assayed for their role in hypertrophy are shown in blue.

Through this interaction, -catenin augments the ligand-dependent activity of AR in prostate cancer cells.",

Binding of TGF-? to its type II receptor in concert with the type I receptor (A) leads to formation of a receptor complex and phosphorylation of the type I receptor. The type I receptor subsequently phosphorylates Smad2 or 3 (B), allowing this complex to associate with Smad4 and move into the nucleus (C). In the nucleus, the Smad complex associates with a transcription factor and this complex binds to specific enhancers in target genes (down-) regulating transcription (D). TNF is able to interfere with TGF-? signaling through the upregulation of the inhibitory Smad7 protein (E). Smad7 is capable of inhibiting the Smad2 and 3 phosphorylating process by competing with the receptor interaction but Smad7 also can dephosphorylate the complex. In addition, Smad7 itself is capable to upregulate TGF? gene expression. As described in the discussion, CSE is most likely capable to interfere with the Smad pathway although this is not yet fully elucidated. (F). Phosphorylated Smad3 is able to stimulate the transcription of the decorin gene (G).",

Binding of TGF-? to its type II receptor in concert with the type I receptor (A) leads to formation of a receptor complex and phosphorylation of the type I receptor. The type I receptor subsequently phosphorylates Smad2 or 3 (B), allowing this complex to associate with Smad4 and move into the nucleus (C). In the nucleus, the Smad complex associates with a transcription factor and this complex binds to specific enhancers in target genes (down-) regulating transcription (D). TNF is able to interfere with TGF-? signaling through the upregulation of the inhibitory Smad7 protein (E). Smad7 is capable of inhibiting the Smad2 and 3 phosphorylating process by competing with the receptor interaction but Smad7 also can dephosphorylate the complex. In addition, Smad7 itself is capable to upregulate TGF? gene expression. As described in the discussion, CSE is most likely capable to interfere with the Smad pathway although this is not yet fully elucidated. (F). Phosphorylated Smad3 is able to stimulate the transcription of the decorin gene (G).",
