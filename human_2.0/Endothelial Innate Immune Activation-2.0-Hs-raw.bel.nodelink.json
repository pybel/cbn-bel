      "description": "The Endothelial Innate Immune Activation network depicts the causal mechanisms that describe acute response of healthy pulmonary endothelium to pro-inflammatory stimuli. These response mechanisms include production of the inflammatory chemokines, adhesion molecules and other mediators during endothelial cells activation leading to lung microvascular endothelial cells dysfunction. The network also includes causal mechanisms associated with angiogenic regulation by immune cells, including drivers of VEGF secretion and other related signaling pathways that crosstalk between the immune system and angiogenesis."

The best characterized of these is the MyD88-dependent pathway, common to all TLRs except TLR3, which results in rapid activation of the transcription molecules nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B), activator protein 1 and Elk-1 and induction of proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

Beside this direct pathway, two other \\\"indirect\\\" channel regulation pathways lead to downregulation of intracellular cAMP. In the first cascade of events, the {alpha}Gi protein subunit inhibits AC activity, thereby reducing the synthesis of cAMP. Inhibition of AC synthesis is viewed as the predominant pathway by which ACh regulates the voltage dependence of f-channels (HCN). The second muscarinic pathway is initiated by the stimulation of the NOS activity and production of NO. NOS activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase (GC), which converts GTP in cGMP. Elevation of cGMP concentration stimulates PDE II-dependent hydrolysis of cAMP, thereby reducing PKA activity. This NOS-dependent pathway for regulation of PKA activity has been proposed to be the major pathway for the muscarinic regulation of ICa,L during pacemaking. In the figure, negative NOS-dependent regulation of Cav1.3-mediated ICa,L and Ist is suggested. It is not known if the SAN IKr can also be negatively regulated by the NOS-dependent pathway.",

      "evidence": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

As shown in Figure 5, wortmannin used at nanomolar concentrations specific for PI 3-kinase inhibition (Arcaro and Wymann, 1993), reduced the human endothelial cells migration induced by VEGF-A165. To determine whether beta3 integrin interferes in PI 3-kinase activation occurring after VEGFR-2 stimulation, we evaluated the effect of BV4 (anti-beta3 subunit mAb) on the phosphorylation in tyrosine residues of the p85 subunit and on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. After pre-incubation with BV4 or with anti-VEGFR-2 Ab for 20 min at 4Â°C, cells were stimulated with VEGF-A165. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 mAb, and the separated proteins by SDSâ€“PAGE were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. VEGF-A165 increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, but it failed to phosphorylate the PI 3-kinase subunit when endothelial cells were pre-incubated with anti-beta3 or anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies (Figure 6).",

      "evidence": "In transgenic mice in which the large T-antigen was expressed in all -cells of the pancreatic islets, carcinomas appeared at approximately 4 weeks of life and the angiogenic switch occurred at approximately 7 weeks in 4-10% of islets [8,9]. The angiogenic switch occurred slightly later in fibrosarcomas arising in transgenic mice carrying the bovine papilloma virus oncogenes [10], or when squamous cell carcinomas arose in mice carrying the human papillovirus type 16 oncogenes targeted to basal cells of the epidermis [11]. The spontaneous angiogenic switch [9] in human tumors can be driven by: (1) angiogenic oncogenes [12] which up-regulate expression of pro-angiogenic proteins (i.e. VEGF, bFGF etc.), and/or down-regulate expression of angiogenesis inhibitors, such as thrombospondin); (2) tumor-associated hypoxic conditions which activate hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) [13], which itself up-regulates angiogenic proteins; (3) fibroblasts in the tumor bed which can be induced by tumor cells to elaborate pro-angiogenic proteins [14]; and (4) bone marrow derived progenitor endothelial cells which traffic to tumors [15]. Of interest is that not all cells in a non-angiogenic dormant human tumor must switch to the angiogenic phenotype for a tumor itself to become neovascularized. Experiments in which human cancer cells both non-angiogenic and angiogenic, are mixed at different ratios before implantation into SCID immunodeficient mice reveal that as few as 1% angiogenic cells will lead to a neovascularized tumor [7]. However, the latent period before a detectable tumor appears is longer with a lower percentage of angiogenic cells (e.g. months with 1% angiogenic cells versus weeks with 50% angiogenic cells). While pre-existing microvessels, are surrounded by normal cells, under some conditions such as in brain metastasis, tumor cells can displace normal cells around a microvessel, a process of vessel cooption [16]. However, new tissue mass requires the recruitment of new microvessels. This principle applies to tumors as well as to normal tissue (such as fat) [17]. Neoplastic tissue usually exceeds the oxygen diffusion limit when tumor cell layers accumulate to a thickness of approximately 150-200 um from a nearest open microvessel. Tumor cells beyond this limit undergo apoptosis (Fig. 1). Therefore, almost any tumor that has reached a diameter of >10-100 mm, is probably already neovascularized. After the angiogenic switch, new microvessels converge on the dormant in situ tumor and tumor cells cluster around each microvessel in a cylindrical configuration. The radius of the microcylinder of tumor cells is limited by the oxygen diffusion requirements for that particular tumor, but it would be rare to find layers of viable tumor cells beyond 200 m (Fig. 1) [18]. The angiogenic switch is associated with a marked decrease (3- to 4-fold) in overall tumor cell apoptosis [5]. In contrast to apoptosis, the proliferation rate of tumor cells may remain at the same level and in many angiogenic tumors appears to be relatively independent of the onset of angiogenesis or its intensity [19]. The mechanisms of increased tumor cell survival and decreased tumor cell apoptosis after the onset of angiogenesis, depend not only on delivery of oxygen and nutrients and the removal of catabolites by new microvessels, but also on a paracrine release of anti-apoptotic factors from the endothelial cells in these new vessels. Microvascular endothelial cells recruited into a tumor bed supply at least 20 mitogens, anti-apoptotic factors, and survival factors (including among others, bFGF, HB-EGF, IL-6, G-CSF, IGF-1 and PDGF) for those tumor cells apposed to the new microvessels [20-22]. It is unclear whether angiogenesis inhibitors also directly decrease endothelial cell production of paracrine factors, but this could be tested in vitro. 3. Antiangiogenic therapy increases apoptosis of endothelial cells and tumor...",

Although Ang II and HB-EGF induce angiogenesis, their link to the angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie2 system remains undefined. We tested the effects of Ang II on Ang1, Ang2, or Tie2 expression in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells expressing the Ang II receptors AT(1) and AT(2). Ang II significantly induced Ang2 mRNA accumulations without affecting Ang1 or Tie2 expression, which was inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitors and by intracellular Ca(2+) chelating agents. Ang II transactivated EGFR via AT(1), and inhibition of EGFR abolished the induction of Ang2. Ang II caused processing of pro-HB-EGF in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner to stimulate maturation and release of HB-EGF. Neutralizing anti-HB-EGF antibody blocked EGFR phosphorylation by Ang II. Ang II also upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in an HB-EGF/EGFR-dependent manner. AT(2) inhibited AT(1)-mediated Ang2 expression and phosphorylation of EGFR. In an in vivo corneal assay, AT(1) induced angiogenesis in an HB-EGF-dependent manner and enhanced the angiogenic activity of VEGF. Although neither Ang2 nor Ang1 alone induced angiogenesis, soluble Tie2-Fc that binds to angiopoietins attenuated AT(1)-mediated angiogenesis. These findings suggested that (1) Ang II induces Ang2 and VEGF expression without affecting Ang1 or Tie2 and (2) AT(1) stimulates processing of pro-HB-EGF by metalloproteinases, and the released HB-EGF transactivates EGFR to induce angiogenesis via the combined effect of Ang2 and VEGF, whereas AT(2) attenuates them by blocking EGFR phosphorylation. Thus, Ang II is involved in the VEGF-Ang-Tie2 system via HB-EGF-mediated EGFR transactivation, and this link should be considerable in pathological conditions in which collateral blood flow is required.",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

The second class contains most direct-acting molecules, including several cytokines, chemokines (157) and angiogenic enzymes (30, 39), which activate a broad range of target cells besides endothelial cells. The prototype member of this group, FGF-2 was one of the first angiogenic peptides to be characterized. The third group of angiogenic molecules includes the indirect-acting factors, whose effect on angiogenesis results from the release of direct-acting factors from macrophages, endothelial or tumor cells. The most extensively studied are tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), which inhibit endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. In vivo, TGF-b induces angiogenesis and stimulates the expression of TNF-a, FGF-2, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and VEGF by attracted inflammatory cells (63, 185). TNF-a has been shown to increase the expression of VEGF and its receptors, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and FGF-2 by endothelial cells, thus explaining its angiogenic properties in vivo (87, 261).",

The first class consists of the VEGF family and the angiopoietins, which specifically act on endothelial cells. The second class contains most direct-acting molecules, including several cytokines, chemokines (157) and angiogenic enzymes (30, 39), which activate a broad range of target cells besides endothelial cells. The prototype member of this group, FGF-2 was one of the first angiogenic peptides to be characterized. The third group of angiogenic molecules includes the indirect-acting factors, whose effect on angiogenesis results from the release of direct-acting factors from macrophages, endothelial or tumor cells. The most extensively studied are tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), which inhibit endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. In vivo, TGF-b induces angiogenesis and stimulates the expression of TNF-a, FGF-2, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and VEGF by attracted inflammatory cells (63, 185). TNF-a has been shown to increase the expression of VEGF and its receptors, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and FGF-2 by endothelial cells, thus explaining its angiogenic properties in vivo (87, 261).",

Pretreatment with BEL inhibited RAW cell adherence after either tryptase or thrombin stimulation. In contrast, stimulation of lung endothelial cells from iPLA2Î²-KOmice with thrombin or tryptase failed to increase RAW cell adherence to the endothelial cell monolayer (Figure 10).

      "evidence": "Effects of hypoxia on molecular determinants of angiogenesis Angiogenesis is a complex process, involving multiple gene products expressed by different cell types, all contributing to an integrated sequence of events44. Consistent with a major role for hypoxia in the overall process, a large number of genes involved in different steps of angiogenesis are independently responsive to hypoxia in tissue culture. Examples include nitric oxide synthases involved in governing vascular tone, growth factors such as VEGF, angiopoietins, fibroblast growth factors and their various receptors, and genes involved in matrix metabolism, including matrix metalloproteinases, plasminogen activator receptors and inhibitors, and collagen prolyl hydroxylase16, 17, 18, 19, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 (Table 1). Similarly, many of the individual phenotypic processes in angiogenesis such as cell migration or endothelial tube formation can be induced by hypoxic tissue culture62, 63, 64. These analyses in isolated systems have sometimes apparently shown both positive and negative effects of hypoxia, for instance on endothelial proliferation65, 66, 67. It is not yet clear whether such phenomena reflect fundamentally different responses based on severity of hypoxia, or counter-regulatory controls that are normally integrated in a productive way.",
