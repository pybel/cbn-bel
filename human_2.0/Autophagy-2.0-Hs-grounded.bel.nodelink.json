      "description": "The Autophagy network depicts the causal mechanisms involved in the induction of autophagy following pulmonary tissue damage as a result of exposure to environmental insults. This includes the regulation of mTOR in the context of autophagy, ATG signaling that leads to autophagic vacuole formation, and regulation of protein translation via S6K and AMPK."

      "evidence": "In autophagy, the autophagosome, a transient organelle specialized for the sequestration and lysosomal or vacuolar transport of cellular constituents, is formed via unique membrane dynamics. This process requires concerted actions of a distinctive set of proteins named Atg (autophagy-related). Atg proteins include two ubiquitin-like proteins, Atg12 and Atg8 [LC3 (light-chain 3) and GABARAP (Î³-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein) in mammals]. Sequential reactions by the E1 enzyme Atg7 and the E2 enzyme Atg10 conjugate Atg12 to the lysine residue in Atg5, and the resulting Atg12-Atg5 conjugate forms a complex with Atg16. On the other hand, Atg8 is first processed at the C-terminus by Atg4, which is related to ubiquitin-processing/deconjugating enzymes. Atg8 is then activated by Atg7 (shared with Atg12) and, via the E2 enzyme Atg3, finally conjugated to the amino group of the lipid PE (phosphatidylethanolamine). The Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex acts as an E3 enzyme for the conjugation reaction of Atg8; it enhances the E2 activity of Atg3 and specifies the site of Atg8-PE production to be autophagy-related membranes. Atg8-PE is suggested to be involved in autophagosome formation at multiple steps, including membrane expansion and closure. Moreover, Atg4 cleaves Atg8-PE to liberate Atg8 from membranes for reuse, and this reaction can also regulate autophagosome formation. Thus these two ubiquitin-like systems are intimately involved in driving the biogenesis of the autophagosomal membrane.",

Atg8 family members are expressed in various tissues, where they participate in multiple cellular processes, such as intracellular membrane trafficking and autophagy. Their role in autophagy has been intensively studied. Atg8 proteins undergo a unique ubiquitin-like conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine on the autophagic membrane, a process essential for autophagosome formation. Whereas yeast has a single Atg8 gene, many other eukaryotes contain multiple Atg8 orthologs. Atg8 genes of multicellular animals can be divided, by sequence similarities, into three subfamilies: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3 or LC3), ?-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) and Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE-16), which are present in sponges, cnidarians (such as sea anemones, corals and hydras) and bilateral animals.",

The FBD is not required for ATG16L1 self-dimerization or interaction with ATG5.

      "evidence": "To test whether mTOR would also phosphorylate Ser371 in vitro, Myc-S6K-WT derived from 293 cells pretreated with rapamycin was used as a direct substrate for HA-tagged mTOR immunopurified from 293 cells. The results show that Myc-mTOR-WT induces increased Ser371 phosphorylation in vitro as assessed by Western blot analysis with the Ser371 anti-phosphospecific antibody following electrophoresis on low acrylamide gels (Fig. 5A), consistent with in vivo findings (Fig. 2A). In contrast, HA-mTOR-KI had no effect. More importantly, in the presence of rapamycin and FKBP12, but not in the presence of either component alone, phosphorylation of Ser371 by mTOR is abolished (Fig. 5A), consistent with the in vivo finding (Fig. 4). In parallel, incubation of S6K1-E389D3E with HA-mTOR-WT also led to increased S6K1-E389D3E activation and Ser371 phosphorylation, in an FKBP-12/rapamycin-sensitive manner (Fig. 5B and data not shown). Furthermore, the extent of both responses was similar to those observed in vivo (compare Figs. 4B and 5B). Therefore, Ser371 phosphorylation appears to be directly regulated by mTOR in vitro and in vivo. (From full text)   Incubation of either S6 kinase variant with wild type, but not kinase-inactive, mTOR led to increased Thr389 phosphorylation, with the extent of Thr389 phosphorylation much higher in S6K1-S371A than in wild type S6K1 (Fig. 6B). However, to achieve the same level of activity as S6K1-WT, S6K1-S371A apparently requires much higher levels of Thr389 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B), consistent with detailed titration studies (data not shown). Although unexpected, these findings are compatible with Ser371 phosphorylation regulating Thr389 phosphorylation and with its ability to directly affect S6K1 activity. (From full text)",

      "evidence": "Akt plays a central role in controlling cell growth, proliferation, survival, and differentiation by phosphorylating a diverse number of protein substrates that contain a minimal consensus sequence of RXRXXS/T (Scheid and Woodgett, 2001). Among these are proteins implicated in metabolism, cell growth, and proliferation such as GSK3, mTOR, and TSC2, and proteins that play roles in apoptosis such as BAD, ASK1, and the Forkhead family of transcription factors FoxOs (Lawlor and Alessi, 2001). It is therefore important to understand how Akt can control such a diverse array of cellular functions. Akt is believed to couple the growth-factor-PI3K signaling pathway to the nutrient-regulated TORC1 signaling pathway (Wullschleger et al., 2006). Following growth-factor stimulation, activated Akt suppresses the GTPaseactivating protein (GAP) activity of the tumor suppressor TSC2/TSC1 complex by phosphorylating TSC2 (Gao et al., 2002; Inoki et al., 2002; Manning et al., 2002; Potter et al., 2002).",
